____________________ TOPIC 1 ______________________________

I really liked how the name of my girlfriend on my ankle turned out but she left me and here we are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All y'all saying "move... Move.. Move... MOVE!" when she's walking up the stairs... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember the time in Riven when you're waking back down a trail you had just walked up and that little girl runs away. Just about jumped out of my skin first time I saw that. Was not expecting anything to start moving. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember playing FFXII in when my five year old daughter walked by and watched.  I killed a guy and he fell. 

"What happened?" she asked.

"It's a sleep stick," I said.  "I hit people with it and they fall asleep."

Five minutes later she's pointing out people and animals that I need to send to bed.  Good thing there was no blood.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunate, I know. Mine did the same back in 2011, I sent her in for refurbish and its been great ever since!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What would happen if while in this self made hell she suddenly closed the portals? Would she end up crushed between the two surfaces?


Maybe someone can recreate this using a storage cube to better test the physics at play.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For a second i thought the camera was about to do a loop around to her behind, but instead all i got was disappointment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think they forgot to shop the hand holding her knee out of the picture where she's leaning forward.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did the girl on the left actually unzip her sweater half way and then turn it around?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agreed. I don't play, but my wife does. We went for a nice 5k walk yesterday with our dog. Where its busy, and full of houses/businesses poke galore. During the 2 miles of empty trail was empty dreams for her 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Screamed like I was a little girl when the first one you find reared up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, but part of that information should be "this is VR, don't run away from things that aren't real".

I don't see many people having this issue of having "involuntary" responses like she did. VR would be doomed otherwise.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In GTA IV I shot a coffee cup out of some chicks hand when she went to take a drink. She stared at it on the ground until I shot her in the head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I nearly cried when my teacher took away my Godzilla tomagachi. I gave her "you better give that back" eyes the rest of the day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she doesn't know what to do with her body and what she got in her hand. A puppy indeed like someone already said. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The face of a woman who just realized she's in a small space with fifteen men who are drinking and rowdy.  The only one with a closed mouth, for the patriarchy has silenced her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I played some horror game on my girls Samsun headset and when the room started flipping itsslf upside down around me that was the only time I felt something physically in that headset. I thought I was going to fall over
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How do i tell her I've been dreaming of her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then Valeera uses Vanish and you scream so loud your mom upstairs drops her KFC bucket
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's seeing what you'd see if you were standing where she is in the game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok let's try and break it down piece by piece. Let's say for the sake of example we follow the experiment as presented in the video but we stop the pistons suddenly when the distance between the two is exactly the height of chel? Does she keep accelerating after her feet have landed on her shoulders or would she slow down? And after we decide on what happens then, what happens when we move the pistons together an inch? A foot?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she still could say that because 1 inch can't make her mouth full
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She'd break the tramp-oline.

Even if they did name it after her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sorry, but the girl is ~~pretty much~~ exactly my dream girl. Fuck. Now I have to find her doppelg√§nger and if it's the last thing I do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try something like skyrim where she can move around freely in the world. Or maybe even something like the walking dead from telltale.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wife said she was turned off by the:

&gt; giant walls of text

In Final Fantasy series.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd leave my girlfriend for this, if I had one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's 3rd girl is 1st, 1st girl is 2nd, and so forth, making the youngest looking last place
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife thought this was real. I was going on about the tightened muscles causing his arm to lash back violently. She almost threw up when she saw it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Grandma is on the phone, she wants her living room back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Better that than having a crush on naked fish girls like me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah she found a time machine went back in time and got tore in half.

Spoiler alert btw.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
as she experiences the terror of an existential crisis while falling through a virtual desk, her light up shoes blink once more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man everything you just said about her were all the things that really turned me on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP made a nightmare room and stuck a nice old junkie/prophet inside. Or they built the room around her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah my girlfriend had the same problem with the same game. That area in the Kokiri village where you walk across a bridge with no guard rail she was constantly falling off. And when she finally made it across and had to turn 90 to go to the next section...she fell.  
Then I asked if I could see, having never played before and walked across first try no problem.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does no one see that the woman is actually standing with her arms in front of her, clasped together?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I lost it when they showed her sitting in mid air swinging her foot and then panned to the actress chilling on her phone in a chair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well can I take her home and sit her on my desk I could use a sexy AI
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn, great Winston play. You fucked them up and didn't let falling off the edge stop you. Also I liked at the end when you were taking that d.va out and you stopped to kill the other lower health squishy in the room next to her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she doesn't like it when you are done, then you have to hang it on *your* wall. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lets build a chair only a 75lb woman can sit in without breaking it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was standing outside the upscale hospital in Vinewood when I witnessed a male NPC walk up to a female NPC who was on the phone. The male waited until the female was done with her conversation then asked if he could have a cigarette. She gave him one and he walked further down to a group of people and asked for a light, they gave him one, they all stood around smoking and then everyone dispersed. I'll never forget that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he/she lands in a bale of hay and walks away, I will at that moment get and leave the cinema....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd be more concerned to be sitting like that girl on the ledge. Seems like she's sitting "Indian style". If for some reason she went over the edge there'd be no way to control how she'd land. In contrast, the dude by the window could at least break the fall with his legs (and break his legs).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's when you invite her to leave, and if she refuses, advise her an official trespass complaint with the police makes a great piece of art to frame in the computer room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Literally moments after I put my Vive on my grandmas head to let her try out VR, she popped me in the face with one of the controllers. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  It can take her from being 7ish heads 

Tracer and head 7 times, you say?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why I have legitimate concerns about the safety of VR. What happens if she ran through a balcony door or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had the hands of a 9 year old girl, but the police took them as evidence. 

____________________ TOPIC 2 ______________________________

This probably wasn't what she meant when she said "I want you inside me."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't care that much but I also don't believe you. Does she consider you get boyfriend? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, he is the only guy there so she isn't wrong 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you serious?  How the fuck does someone's ability have anything to do with whether or not their opinion is valid?

First off, their opinion was not in the video, as there is no commentary.  

Second, he/she is not showing or telling someone how to play.  It's literally just them playing.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't one of the devs comment on the ending saying her accepting his lie was her way of realizing she knows she can't rely on him to do everything in her life? 

I feel like she has to know he's lieing and now she realizes she can't trust him for everything in her life and needs to take more charge of her own life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've never played it (though I think that may change soon.) but I'm assuming that it's not supposed to be as easy as she makes that look? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope. That's an after titties sort of convo. Unless you are a pro. Don't mention it until she's already attached
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well its not the stubborness its more that she is presented as a perfect character with no flaws
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;All I know is there are two theories to arguing with women and neither one works.

John Marston
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I knew she was selfish before we got married, but my gosh, I had no idea it would be this bad!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on her opinion of Snowden, I could *totally* see that happening
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if ellie kills Joel after she finds out :O
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I honestly still can't believe people care about mobile games this much. Nothing against it, don't get me wrong, a game is a game. Its just crazy to an old lady like me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree with the girl, it as always better to play someone else's game. So you could just play for a while and move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We must find solace in the fact that she's intentionally making herself miserable by lying to herself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You claimed widowmaker's not supposed to kill people in the objective. I told you she is. That's because you can do more than one thing at once. If you only do one thing and ignore the others, you ARE playing wrong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NOLF gets a series. Not really, But I like to think that Cate Archer was a codename and now She goes by Mallory Archer and her and her son are spies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is there no need to qualify it? If the context was altered and a woman was in place of Geoff then I guarantee the reception would be different.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Understood, I am looking a for a game that I could get my girlfriend interested in.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Poor Gary, hits it then quits it as she totally one night stands him. I was sad when Garys witcher senses could no longer follow the scent of lilac and gooseberry
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then she pointed out that I killed it faster than anyone else. I thought she was lying and CC would be ok!

I thought *sob* it was a lie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish I could've seen it but part of me thinks Ellie knew when she asked anyway, she's not stupid. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has just seen me play it and she knows nothing on it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it's not like she has anything better going on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, if they're having Joel dead it would rather be that he acts more like Ellie's moral subconsciousness, she seems pretty angry in the trailer, and having a group of raiders kill Joel seems like the only thing that would set her off unto a quest for vengeance

They could have them kill the people in the town Joel and Ellie arrive at in the end of the first game, but I would think then that Joel would be the angry one and Ellie be the voice of reason. When Joel is being the voice of reason and Ellie is the angry one, it seems fully possible that Joel is already dead
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she knew everything, but needed Joel to lie to her so it wouldn't weigh on her conscience. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No no, I was unsure who she was supposed to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You poor girl you have no idea the can of worms you've opened up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Considering she said this almost a decade ago when nearly all senators were against Vidja games  I doubt anyone cares really
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she stood up to every challenge, no matter however demanding.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Him and the girl on the other side. They both do the exact same thing with the exact. Same. Timing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;"But possibly another woman on the ballot who may be a tad bit crooked."

Trump's toupee?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No one has said it yet? Fine I will. *clears throat*

r/upvotedbecausegirl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gott be careful with your plorts man :( same thing happened to my girlfriend and she was devastated 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope you informed her that, had she looked into it, she coulda gotten up to ten times that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; there are female characters in Star Wars Battlefront . It's true to the source material.

Is it really though? The game is based off the original movies, and I don't remember seeing any female soldiers or officers on either side aside from Leia. If there were any, there weren't many of them, definitely not enough to really justify complete player freedom.

I don't mind the women in Battlefront, but to say that it's accurate and true to the source material is just wrong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then at the end the kid she's with gets infected and turns and Ellie has to kill him/her. Ellie realizes the selfishness of Joel's (and her own) decision to not try and cure the disease and Ellie ends up sacrificing herself to some entity that was an antagonist throughout the game?  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I killed her so many times doing this on purpose ... don't judge me :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You now even misunderstanding the very simple phrase "This is my photo" do you honestly think I meant she would own all the rights to that photo?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Considering all the male characters are just lady fanservice I'm okay with this
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know exactly when the video is from, and I don't care enough to go look it up, but she says "As a mom and a Senator". She hasn't been a senator for over a decade, so I am pretty sure this is way before the email scandal, either of her presidential runs, or anything else going on right now.
 

Knowing Hillary, I'm sure her position on this will have changed the second popular opinion on the subject did =P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't say she's a mutant but she's definitely a moaner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She knew that the whole time. She basically says so in the very end. It's what she wanted. If you don't get that then you need to replay it. Also the leader of the fireflies was basically her second mother and very clearly cared for Ellie. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Has anyone else noticed that Pharah's eyes seem to change color when she blinks?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thats Hellla true you hella said girl damn y u so right all the time right on point hella true that is hella hella hella hella
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
obviously she was coerced by The Patriarchy^TM as women cannot make their own decisions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact that she probably doesn't know anything about Pokemon and did this just to see the joy that her grandkid would get out of receiving it makes it so heartwarming.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I do agree with the sentiment, you're making a lot of assumptions about OP's girlfriend. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the most emotional scene was Joel and Ellie discussing Sarah after she runs away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not stopping him/her from drawing whatever they want. Like the person I replied to, I think it stands out - that's not a criticism though. 

____________________ TOPIC 3 ______________________________

Isn't he the boss at the end of the bunny girl area too?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's really crazy. Mine was the same. Although it was call of duty which is probably a bit of a harder game to play if you've never really gamed. But yeah she couldn't work out how to look or move properly, always ended shooting into the air. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In fairness, she didn't miscarry because the baron attacked her. His attacking her made her want to miscarry so she asked the Crones who obliged and turned the baby into a botchling!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, the infamous [Ming Xiao temple](/spoiler) was  pretty shit. Yet I was definetely able to go through it with Jaegerspas and Magnum revolver as Toreador. Boss was hard, but then I understood that [you don't have to worry avout adds as only one will grow at a time. Used celerity to dodge attacks and used like 2 blood packs staying at a close range near the back of Ming. Killed her in like two minutes.](/spoiler) And then things got even easier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*Missile blows up in front of her and throws her into brick wall*

"Ouch!"

*keeps running.* 

Lara is a fucking trooper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Turns out she hit up, up, down, down, l, r, l, r, b, a, start and cheated on him.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love playing her. I don't understand why more people don't. She is not the best tank but she has this tank / support thing going on that is very strong and her damages can be huge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
her ult wasn't the stun, you can see the stun in the bottom right as one of her abillities, her ult is the damage booster she used on the rein because after she used it her ult meter was at 1%
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vicar punishes you for playing safe. If you play aggro she won't usually try to heal. Also, with the dlc, there is an NPC summon that will tank her for you. Don't even need the dlc to summon him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He keeps looking back and forth at Lydia like: "Are you seeing this?". And she's like: "I didn't do it stop fucking looking at me"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is. She doesn't take damage but she still takes knockback and hitstun.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thinks it's more supposed to be the stereotypical magical girl transformation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really? As DVA I've been destroying him (and.. well everyone) in fights. I think she's the more broken of the two. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got the same endrb√∫a spelling, but couldn't find any correlation anywhere. If its correct, good find. Where did you come by a translation?

Also, after her kills the giant, the next area seems to have two words spelled in runes. Did you check those out at all?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Final Fantasy XV. I was fighting this chick and she was kicking my ass, so I activated my super attack. I started doing work and she jumped into the air. Not to be outdone, I followed her. And then that quick little fight scene happened. Just beautifully well done. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can actually fight her In the beginning after you get the banner to fly away after the second boss. But after you get the banner if you keep hitting her she turns into the dancer then lol she fucks you up. Well fucked me up a least so underleveled 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"At once dude" 

"Psh, PASS. I'm not trying to get a nobody. Get me a girl that has hit triple digits"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Personally I was annoyed with what happened to Samus with the zero suit because it took her away from being some 6 foot plus amazonian warrior. If the zero suit never happened then Other M might not have happened.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and she drops her soda right before getting hit.  Now that's some detailed shit.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll bite the bullet and volunteer to be locked underground with her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus she doesn't die, which is why I always brought her with me. She's like Shadowmere that shoots things
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How come she get health back if it's not time?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is also completely defenseless and has no offensive ability other than to stop healing and take out her gun. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
never got the lydia lovefest. she died for me taking on some witches. thats when i realised she ain't about that life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It'll be recharged by the time she runs back basically
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only full if she was full 4 seconds prior. Otherwise it heals her to that point. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lingerie Hockey League. Where guys with a battered woman fetish go to see girls covered in bruises from blocking shots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I kind of thought it was neat how you could determine your level of handicap going in to that final fight, too.  Example being, rush straight to her door and you can only auto attack.  On the other hand, it could be annoying on subsequent games to unlock all your abilities.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
McCree is great to protect the payload against flankers like Reaper, Tracer and Genji while still having great ranged damage with his left click.

Pharah is good to stay around the payload because her long range and high damage allowing her to deal high damage behind Reinhardt's shield while quickly going up in the air in team fights.

Not that the offense or defense really matters because Hanzo and Widow are used on offense a lot more than defense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women in battle is just taking it too far 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but there's a delay. I'm suggesting that she should be able to immediately restore that if the ability is up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you hit the wall button again it shatters.  If Mei dies before she can do that then it stays for the full timer.  Your Mei just sucks and is cancer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus she gives you ammo and health so thats a bonus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if Metroid actually *was* a girl in the games?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet she plays Symmetra and puts the teleporter on the edge of a cliff...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Use black Knight shield and hug her, blocking for the aoe.

Can kill her with almost no damage taken for the whole fight. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd argue her alt fire is defensive as well, since it moves so slow but bypasses shields and continues on through targets makes it less of an offensive attack and more of an area denial technique.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not in my experience. Low on salts, she gets me salts. Low on ammo, she gets me ammo. Dying, she gets me a medpac. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of it has to do with the fact that her head shot placement is like front and center and super easy to hit. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now you know her special ability. But wall hack is when I can see through walls and obstacles when I shouldn't be able to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SPOILER:

no spider-man debunked that myth when Gwen was dropped from a high point and bounced off the ground but spiderman caught her before the  second bounce and she still ded
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lucio or Zenyatta depending on the map and if we're attacking or defending. Soldier 76 is the only offensive char I'm even half decent with, and I can play DVA in a pinch, but I'm terrible with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's cause she's furrowed her eyebrows in the second one  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I did that (within days of release) the game glitched out and I wasn't able to leave the area. He attacked her,  the guards attacked him,  spell wore off, but she hit him again so the guards attacked her.  She was killed eventually,  but I couldn't exit the area. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Brutal! The car that hit her lost the bumper but didn't even slow down!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's correct, but her flash is another evasive maneuver that decreases even more incoming damage, and lets her heal more often than Bastion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'd fight Mom and people after her. More of the game unlocks the more you play. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Press E, or whatever you have her wall skill on, again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dancer is one of those bosses I've never had trouble with. Everything she does is pretty telegraphed, and she's not very fast. Just keep hitting and keep running.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the Sprite the one with the offensive spells? Because if so, I'm pretty sure that's a "she" not "he".

____________________ TOPIC 4 ______________________________

Once, by a member of the PMS clan in Halo 2. Those girls could kick ass and they were not shy about letting people know that you got your ass kicked by a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cait is used to injecting hard pricks into her. ;D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like Jenova should be a queen, and Yuffie should not, because fuck her for stealing my materia.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one that really wants to punch that bitch in her face?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's gotta be handy for livestreaming the girl tied up in your basement 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It wouldn't be the same without her laughing. It's like a laugh track, but at least 56x better. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man I feel bad for the girl because the game will just crash.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;what she said about you're about road and her's.

About your road and hers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Makes me wonder if her ass looked any better with the Justin Bailey code.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought that girl was going the land back in the jeep somehow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now I want to see someone who has a fetish with naked girls whose heads are litterally train cars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dont forget solas although you have to be a female elf
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that a bottle of lubricant on her bat belt? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clickers bite into her neck with blood gushing everywhere and all over her face while she screams
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I used Jun I'd get going on her combos and never stop. So much rage I'd incur. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no she didn't. 

everyone knows women can't take pictures without them in it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know, there are creepier things she could be laughing her head off at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's so good at hacking, she doesn't need to flip her head ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Queen of pain eh? So she is.. hurtin for a squirtin?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;!my 

So it's not *your* name that's Trevor. No wonder she jumped
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you look on other parts of the pictures than her ass, you might get lucky. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not a single woman in the room! This game is going to kick ass
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, I wish they had more of the music from the cut scenes and will always go back and hog tie women for the train gods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want front row seats to her sweet butt trumpet symphony and a backstage tour of the orchestra pit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was itchin to get in on it. You can see the blood lust in her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is that a part of her vag or her crotch?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Steal the car get a prozzie, intercorse her moot hole, tell her to think about what she's done.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When i got to this part in game i was on my knees begging her to take the rest of it off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
put your cock next to her face and see if she can smell it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then tell her to put up the sticks, yet to find a 3 year olds whoes ass I couldn't kick.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, they just flipped her around and figured no one would notice?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she goes feral shadow or whatever it really creeps me out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So where does she get cars to run people over?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I keep accidentally chopping her face off with my axe. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's not nearly angular enough to pull it off. There's not a single point on her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was convinced of that after the first scene when she puts in the earbuds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That final kick at the end... Willing to instantaneously catch himself on fire just to kick a dead guy for accidentally punching a girl. Gotta love a guy with morals.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was on a bike ride with my wife the other day and started pretending to kick her bike and yelled "road rash!". 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she got addicted to skooma man... skoomaheads will do that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was wondering the same thing, it's just a picture and she doesn't even look mildly amused.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I kind of chuckled when the character in the red sweater just knocks that girl down as he goes by, and she falls.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she die from getting Falcon Punched in the face or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Can the girl NOT smell Charlie?  Can the guy NOT see...Dee?" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll clap because I'll get a car, and she'll get a car and you get a car
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or when it verbally assaulted its interim CEO only for her to have done absolutely nothing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess its time to cut ties with her. It was a good run!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The zipper running down the crack of her ass is a key part of this cosplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how he knocks her over with the binder.  Women love binders.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shotgun to the back of the witches head kills her instantly if i remember rightly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the person in the car is a girl, but it looks like she's in the passenger seat, so the car probably belongs to the guy filling up the car 

____________________ TOPIC 5 ______________________________

I don't have it in me to call her a bitch haha. But I've always called her a punk since she was a kid. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;i bet the ladies are all up on.  

I like to place my grace in their tact tracts.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that girl needs to play more pokemongo and eat less doritos
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but she has a surface to deploy the bipod on. That's how it works in game as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is her look so empty? Kinda looks like a puppet or if she is daydreaming
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think they are closed, actually. They are painted on her eyelids, no?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my corpses. 

Cold and rotting. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not disputing any of your points, and actually you've made me want to rewatch the show again. But on the surface it looks girly - I've had to push and push just to get my SO to watch a few episodes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks. I'm going to see if she's got anything I can beat off to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea but who is Yennifer and why do I want to find her so bad?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a gentleman, so I use my Likitung on her Cloyster before charging in there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, it is quite comfy. My wife steals it a lot, even though she has a few she made for herself 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's probably cheating on you too, if anything has been for years 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet Mongo, whoever she/he/it is, does not like to get poked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always thought Granny was kinda lying. Tetra is pretty dishonest and she sees it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kylo Ren was a bitch. But of course they needed a bitch-villain even a woman could defeat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I totally hated that bitch before she was annoying at E3"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gasp! Your girlfriend is actually El Blanco Magnifico, the greatest women's wrestler of all time!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, theres a seam only where her vagina would be but her vagina is invisible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ive hated preston from the moment i met him. Hate that annoying woman who bitches a lot as well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me and my crew did her while you were sniffing glue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not even trolling, but does she by chance have autism
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because someone is girly doesn't mean they can't like other things too. I don't see why a Girly Girl would object to, say, Sorry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't worry, it's Cinnabon frosting. They're trying to find out where she hid the other Cinnabons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell. I swear she's been eating a lot of Taco Bell lately...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet that isn't even the skull of her real mother.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every time she mentions her vagina I just fucking lose it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she cheated on you? You just gonna let that happen??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet she is super annoying to be around at a con. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I sure do like when girls do that thing where they get naked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tina, always bothering me. Asking for "lunch recommendations"...you know what she really wants to do at lunch.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The white paint is actually glue. That's why she can climb it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the bottom half of her is a giant spider. some people are really into that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well yea I get that but how was she "changing" they way we gamed?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet this puffled her jiggles when she found out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, she tries hard to get what she's looking for.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What happen to her nipple? Did you bite it off?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha good thing I'm a woman ;)

It looks neat, thanks!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; [Bitch I got a life and a girl to fuck.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But what about when she eats. What happens to her lunch if she time travels. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One of the few singleplayer games I've bothered to finish (TR 2013). I absolutely adored it too and loved what they did with the her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that by that dumb bitch that uses her vagina to get people to watch her videos? Because there's no other reason that shit should be viral.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still need to actually finish all the routes. My girlfriend is farther through than I am.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's built like a pro wrestler!

...

Is she a pro wrestler?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is what I put Marcy in. It makes her bitching funnier. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are, on one boys have a penis and on the other girls have a vagina.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe she just finished it and was trying it on? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always hated playing against ivy. Av friend of mine mastered her just to spite me. To be fair I mastered Voldo top spite him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks.  I just want her to do her own thing, so I let her do what she wants for the most part.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's actin like a bitch because she does it soo well.

____________________ TOPIC 6 ______________________________

Not trying to argue about if said concerns are valid. Just that they'd have infinitely more impact on the average woman then how they are portrayed in *fictional* media.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
GTA isn't a great example as you can easily make a black female character in the multiplayer, and go and mow down millions of white men. So it's easy to point out that it's equally racist and sexist towards everyone!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
boo...violet hold is major suckage. Is she using a Doomgaurd? please tell that women to spec into sacrifice. Lurn2play nub...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rosalina is Peach's daughter from the future, and Luigi is her father. But that's just a theory.  
  
A GAAAAME THEEORRYYYY.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Violent video games increase aggression as much as lead lowers IQ. What is the conversion metric here? Is aggression now quantified in IQ? The only reason she even mentions this is to make the connection of giving games to kids is like making them eat lead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One person (me) is a sufficient counterexample, but it's not exactly as if this is a novel claim I'm making. Lots of men, including evolutionary psychologists, have claimed that men have lower standards than women. It's not just me saying it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's Blindspot that does it the most, as it causes her to be in New York to film for large portions of the year. The rest of them are able to maintain the show and their other work because it's all based out of L.A.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Making an argument for how men are portrayed in media is a different discussion than how women are portrayed. While both are good discussions to have, one does not discuss the colors of apples when talking about the colors of oranges.

You're not alone in taking this approach, and I am not attempting to belittle you. It just seems strange to speak of badly thought out arguments using a badly thought out argument.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure there is, he has racial quotas! Gotta have that office diversity. /s

Affirmative Action is racist in itself. I don't see how they can't see that forcing an elevation of a group of people isn't in itself racist, because it implies that they can't get it otherwise. 

Equality of opportunity, not outcome, you know? Let the best man win. Or woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just got a new Indian coworker, I'm going to show her how we do things in america.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"This is me when she says she likes guys who are violent because they play video games."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It really is fascinating. As she makes these paintings she is also studying the culture and has been trying to incorporate little nods to the culture wherever she can. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It doesn't matter when they do it.  What I"m saying is, if people were truly about representation like they say they are, we would be seeing more specifics requests for representation of groups of people who are rarely, if ever represented in games.

Now, if you're going to start talking about ratios (more women than black people), then there are more men in the industry who make games and more guys who play console games like Zelda and as such, Link should stay a male character to represent those who actually play the games more.  As such, people shouldn't get upset that people want Link to stay male.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't represent the real female form. When are we going to have a chubby Queen?     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost a foot above average height for women in most western countries, and all the women I know above 6' jokingly call themselves amazons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a 5'6 male, I weigh about 180 and I can tell you she shouldn't be so chunky, it's the clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does a MacGuffin.

Just because her role is important doesn't make it substantial or representative or even a protagonist's role.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I told my colleagues and they learnt to accept it. I'm a 28 year old who works in a female dominated office. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is true for anything not just Americans though. Females like to be able to play as a woman in the game. African Americans like to see some sort of representation as do gays. Everyone wants to see someone that they can relate to
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But since it was a pussy pass topic she thought like that because of gender.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For real?! If it was a white girl who said something like that about a black girl you really don't think that would be an issue?....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't like $Hillary either, but this was 20 years ago and she had self-described "experts" telling her it was true. Although that whole "Video games increase aggressive behavior as much as lead poisoning decreases IQ" is as hilarious a statement as I could ever think of. So are we talking percentage points or the ratio of IQ points to percentile of aggressive behavior? Lol.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Video games are international, and according to that logic kids in every country where video games are played should be as violent as in USA (according to her logic). The problem with violence is not video games, it's something else.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure half of you in this thread are children, so this is probably going to fall on deaf ears, but you people should really take a gender studies course. The way that you people are minimizing/discounting real problems concerning female representation in video games is quite honestly abhorrent. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We live in a sexist world. Just because I guy can shoot it, doesn't mean a girl can't flick it. Move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is Donkey Kong her favorite game or is it one of the others?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, this series perplexes me so much. I think it's inarguable that MGS has a problem with over-sexualizing women, but simultaneously, the overwhelming majority of female characters are incredibly strong and resourceful, and frequently even superior at what they do when compared to their male counterparts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she was campaigning based off some bullshit about how (cherry picked no doubt) studies have shown that violent videogames create violent adults and compared it to lead poisoning.

There is no link between playing violent games and being violent proven so far, so she's deliberately misinforming parents in her attempt to inform them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*And not just the men.  But the women.  And the Children to.  They're like animals, and you SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE ANIMALS!*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not disagreeing with that, really. Bad writing is an issue. But portrayal of people in general, men and women, do help to define our culture, what we define as 'ideal' for men and women, not only in how they look but also how they act, and when this happens a lot in media, it can lead to bad habits or self-image issues. And I do take issue with that. That's not an issue limited to women, but that's what the discussion is focused on so I just weigh in on that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hale was also the voice of the 90s Spiderman character Black Cat, and most of the female parts of 90s childhoods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
.... said every girl ever when this topic comes up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see no issue with that, only wish i had her name... for..yaknow, research.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was worried they were going to make Mario see a female orgasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I totally agree. I feel like the people that are losing their shit over it set this up into a black and white, us or them mentality. Even in that narrative their logic flawed.

Blizzard can do whatever it wants. I will support this game with a preorder because of its diverse cast and excellent portrayal of women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's their game you fucking crybaby, if you don't like it don't buy it or go make your own game. Your opinion doesn't, and will never, matter.

There isn't a black protagonist in Zelda, all the characters are white. How come you want a white female and not a black female? Are you racist? What a bigot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He does have a fedora on. His just treating m'lady how ask her chads treat her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There never is both, coming from. A country where talking about honour related violence against women is considered racist and islamophobic by the same people calling for "mantax" makes one slightly biased..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My bad.  I was thinking of her as Gwen Stacy, who is like 17.  

...

Which kind of shows the problem--the audience would be likely to think of her as a babe in arms too.  Like I said--it'd be creepy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe it's an objection to the way the government treats women in the country? 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The whole "anti-SJW" movement seems to be mostly men who are afraid of getting rejected by women because of their aggressive courting attempts anyway. It's like how white people in the South think that the Black Live Matters protestors are going to literally kick their doors down and berate them for being religious, or whatever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was finding Nemo pass topic she thought because of her favourite film
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she claims its backed up by '40 years of research' and this video can be seen as an indicator on her general stance towards the medium.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For fucks sake...the girl and the tiger...I couldn't even watch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet another unrealistic standard of beauty for women in video games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; women aren't as biased towards looks as men are
 
You don't actually believe this, do you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can still tell it's a white girl and black guy!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're horribly mislead. The wage gap doesn't exist (there is an *earnings* gap, which does not factor in things like hours worked, job positions, etc) but for the exact same work a woman would be payed the same amount as a man. 

On the other front, we have the police killing black people. Only 15% of America's population is black. They are responsible for 50% of America's violent crime, and 25% of police murders are black people. It's pretty clear that it isn't being black that causes police to kill people, it's committing violent crimes. And as it happens, black people commit more violent crime (relative to their population %). This is not racism. These are statistics.

There are a few cases of indiscriminate police killing of blacks (which I in no way support - it is disgusting regardless of the race of the victim) which are blown massively out of proportion by activists and the media, when in fact most of the indiscriminate police killing victims are white.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;true feminism is about equality

there is a reason why every dictionary defines feminism as being pro-women either exclusively or at least as primary meaning.

Historically since birth of the movement it has **never** been about equality for all genders. Even in speeches mentioning equality it was always in context of making sure women were treated no less than men, but never the other way around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
congrats now you know how the rest of us feel when they cast a Scot to play an Egyptian and cast a white girl to play a Japanese person...This is where you get the answer the rest of us minorities get...get over it. 


Feel better Now? No, I know you don't.

____________________ TOPIC 7 ______________________________

Except the game doesn't end when the female dies. It ends when the male becomes impotent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No worries, man. Or woman....or human....errr, you know what I mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well that is because some angels are girls as well 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do not like the game either, she did not like the workplace and quit halfway through to work on another game. I just found the motive beatiful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, it doesn't have to be two girls. There are many variegated and deep combinations of futa...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mass Effect or should I say mass erect. Amirite ladies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's also mostly filler creating that effect though. Much like a girls eyebrows. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Since I recently played The Evil Within, I was completely immune to any horror they create.  If you haven't played The Evil Within, the spider demon women in that game are just insanely more horrific and terrifying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks fantastic, but I can't stop looking at her boomerang eyebrows.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When Jenny (your girlfriend) dies in front of you because you are being held, powerless, by the darkness. And then you kill yourself just to wake up in hell. Game: The Darkness 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like Olive Oil trying to get Popeye to save her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean criticising a woman is not sexist, doing death threats is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was like four or something. I think she dies in one of them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jill, hopefully. It's been way too long since she was the start of a main Resident Evil. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Dwarf Fortress, men and women look exactly the same.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder if she will still have her invisibility powers in 2
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thought that was Brit Murphy at first; "she's still alive?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She only dies if you give her the killing blow. No mobs can kill her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she's not recalling far enough to before she got dressed. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hi, can you PM me your organization and location? My wife works at an independent living facility and she may be interested in this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's women all over the planet. Have you tried looking for them instead? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like that moment in Mass Effect when I punched that female reporter...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why didn't they get her to do the live action film?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell, I'll take it if you don't want it. My girl loves Frozen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that poor woman just wanting to get to the other building had to die
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she does seem to be the games' "Ryu" by looking at the rest of her moveset.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The three females I've played with the most main a female troll, a female orc, and a female tauren. They aren't teenagers, go figure :b
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Itman : Absolution. You must save the girl from becoming it, the best tag game of all time
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Alarm + fireworks was mass mayhem too. Also useful for unleashing hell in the girl's dorm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Another pretty universal law for that game is that if there's a girl talking in the lobby, there's ALWAYS a guy trying to impress her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this a spartan 4 or a spartan 2?

That name is confusing the hell out of me. If its a 2, she shouldnt have a full name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He saved earth but released her as a side effect. It's why we see her 2 seconds in AC4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh look..

It's the girl from the last of us, beyond 2 souls, life is strange, resident evil lesbians..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you think that she's a robot in the first place!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the transition.

"Follows law perfectly."

"Finds explosives."

The rest is implied.  There aren't many intact vehicals in her save are there?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Deep and dank, just like how I like my women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cause her faith is her armour, you don't need armour when Elune herself protects you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Negative, she was just evil and betrayed Tyrael whilst killing Leah to help Diablo breach the heavens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I don't recall how far along she is, but she wasn't all woman at the start.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man I never landed a parry on that dude and she can do it blindfolded.  Impressed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I want to play a game. Let's play, Hide and Seek. Those were her exact words."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she had taken my sega, though, i would have gone to jail for murder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet Hitler would be shedding tears right now if her were watching this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he was the bad guy in the first game too.  That guy could have saved humanity and so many other girls like Ellie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Halo is my childhood.

Cortana is my fucking BAE (well, Chief found her first, but she's still mine too).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
301 spartations, has a sex scene with her in it.

Wasn't really interested in the rest of the movie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's an invisibility cloak, but it only makes you invisible to women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did he... did he just fuck her to death ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Correct! You'd either need to restart or try again on NG+ (which is effectively restarting). 

Protip: don't let her die.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but Priscilla had more of that innocent girl feeling to her

____________________ TOPIC 8 ______________________________

Find out who among the three you like. Get the same tattoo as hers done but with the colors inverted. Tell her: "You complete me."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't. It was an assumption.

Though, if she didn't make it, then she could also not apply her own face paint, which would then not require any effort from her as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If only he put that much effort into finding a girlfriend
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
maybe its milk :/ especially if she's a mother like i said...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But men lack the ~~mammory~~ ~~mamory~~ *specific internal boob-organs* that women have.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've always wondered but... how the hell do you get a scar in a curvy-snake like shape? It's like someone was doing an autopsy on her and got creative.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In [Soul Calibur V]( her wardrobe was toned down a bit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And it's rockin style. Don't let your girlfriends tell you any different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at the expanse of skin in the upper-ass, lower-back region.

That is *definitely* a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you send me a hair off her head for.. Reasons. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cut down like so many japanese schoolgirls in the night...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does it have hair? In FF7 her "hair" was just the wires attached to the thing on her head
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
however, at least in icelandic, and probably old norse, she would need to add an 'r' to the Valhalla, so that it would make grammatical sense... "Til Valhallar" would be "To Valhalla" in old norse / iceland... I'm not sure about norwegian/danish/sweedish/faroese but if I recall correctly it works the same way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what you didn't realize is that her sports bra is also a makeshift smelter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Japanese women tend to be very small. It's not as uncommon as you mite think. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apparently she was pretty or had some pretty large physical features
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure where you got the idea that men and women have such different postures. [They]( [don't]( Structurally, they're strikingly similar barring their proportions. Perhaps you, too, have just grown accustomed to the way they're always presented?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's still a Cid in FFXV, so in Japan it's Cid and Cidney.

Similar to in FFV, when Cid had a grandson, Mid.

I'm not sure why they changed Cidney to Cindy in the US/EU. Cidney (Sidney) is a common enough English female name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she wants to do it by hand that makes sense, world edit would have been useful tho :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you base her stats on her file in game?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fair enough on her reasoning, but it doesn't make it any less rapey.  Not at all.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just practicing for his little girls sleepover.... Light as a feather stiff as a board

&gt; His abilities

I thought Tone was a She.

(Ion, Tone and Northstar have female voices)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably a reference to some people, and he/she is speaking to them, hence the word "you".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Someday, I want a woman who is as turned on by something oddly specific as you are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd say a lot of women do. I'm not one personally, but I've referred several acquaintances to it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are correct. You can use frame by frame in VLC to see her tail and wings more clearly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is a perfect example, especially if you want to co-op with her. It can be challenging but more brain teasing than actually difficult. A+ suggestion
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was hard to do Cammy, her hair keeps getting in the way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She also looks at a little holographic projection in one of her emotes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if you're referring to that one of the anime chick with semen all over her face that was incredibly poorly shooped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess she though it was just a bit .... too real 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a guy that likes a lot of things that are considered feminine. My personality has also been called pretty in-between masculine and feminine. So I like to create girl characters as a way to sort of physicalize how in-between my nature is. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dont see the short hair and long hair thing.


Edit: nvm i see it, a woman in the rock
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
mine has as well

you can remove MOST of the greyish color in the advanced skin color picker (were you pick 5 different layers of color)

i changed my bright blue faced female char to a bit more blushy red, that was the best i could do, even though the skin color i picked originally was regular Caucasianish 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to extend my reach to her stars above...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh it looks nice but the aspect ratio is off. They need to take this image and stretch it along the X axis by like a handful of pixels because it looks like her head was squished:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Does not tell." True but to be fair, most women have long hair and most men short. Therefore, my statement is not saying "HE MUST BE A GIRL" I said he LOOKS like a girl because as stated previously, women usually long hair and men short hair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Naw, either can be correct depending on the meaning you're going for. This dude's just correcting the sentence to fit her opinion.

Why does she have semen leaking from her nipples?

EDIT: I know it's milk. Looks like goddamn wood glue. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if my girlfriend put that on it wouldn't be on for very long

edit: grilfriend  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
meh we all know real women look like this


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right about female muscles but Gadot doesn't look like she does anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whoa, what are the odds of finding a small woman AND a small man. Truly remarkable. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are we referring to the woman "blowing" the autopilot back up?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about male with internal genitalia for women and male with external genitalia for men?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's probably why he seems so uninterested on a *fucking anime girl*.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When do you figure she'll be done with this project?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know if she's one in particular but she's a slytherin student, you can see she has a wand on her hip.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All SF girls seem to be thick af

No complaints.

....Can she make another one? For my daughter? I might just borrow it from her now and then.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she playing it for the original DS or 3DS? I bought a 3DS just for New Leaf and it's got much more content.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep now you have a Wii U and for some odd reason in x and y if you play as a girl she starts the game holding a Pikachu 3DS.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she also makes the tags so people know that the dolls are there on purpose and that they're allowed to keep them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Back when iPhones had just come out, Grandma bought me an iPhone case for Christmas thinking it was an actual iPhone. Poor grandma thought she could buy an iPhone for $10 at CVS. Best phone case I never used! Still one of my favorite Christmas presents, just 'cause I LOVE MY GRAM GRAM!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
indeed, still love her more than anything ('cause mom). the real test is being raised around stuff like that, but not hiding behind the 'different time' or 'grew up with' excuse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom is 55 and knows nothing about pokemon. Today she told me " I killed a pokemon today at work!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He said she started making in fathers day for him so he does have children. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she's 89, she would be born the same year as the first television. So, I suppose it's possibe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is probably one of the most adorable things I've ever seen...mostly because I have a daughter (she's a 1 year old) who I gave an old DualShock2 so she could have a controller and sit with my wife and I when we play.  She's always trying to get the DS3's we're holding, so I let her join in with her own controller.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually think the woman is his daughter, not his wife...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A gift of 6 year old parts that were cobbled together from 3 different people to replace the old laptop that her parents got for work? Yeah, that family must be fucking loaded. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't the alleged mother let her underage daughter play the game?

Sounds like a breach of ToS.

Make sure you find the girl you like and tell here, "I'd like to take a pikachu".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Better get rid of her iPhone and buy an Android while she's at it too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am after buying my girlfriends Christmas gift, shit's expensive yo
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She loves minecraft but has trouble doing things because of the way her fingers can't reach the controls (on a controller) and I am trying to have her understand the WASD concepts :)

Thanks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I highly recommend beat hazard. My gf and i love playing it, she uses the xbox controller and i use the keyboard. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 7 years old and my mom said she will buy me any game I want

I said I want sonic on a gameboy! *(I had a sega and my friend had a gameboy, I thought it was possible)*

she gave me some LCD hand held game like one of these. At least it was sonic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't actually see the controller in her hand.  It might not even be her playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had one in my SoulSilver.... had to get rid of her for Lugia though :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seeing as she was using her parents old work laptop to play games, and now has been given 6 year old hand me down parts, I'm sure she'd like to have rich parents as well. Good thing she has a loving family though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A coworker's 8 year old son asked her for it as a gift. Blew my mind, but made happy despite not playing the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You too?! I almost had a daughter and called her Nadia (The spanish translation they gave to Jenna), but had a son instead so... Yeah

Glad to know there was people like me who loved the game this much
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I made my mom play Portal. First game she ever completed, I was very proud.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't be the first time Troy Baker has played a father figure hallucination for a female protagonist...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't have responsibilities. Just kids and a woman who tell me what to do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His mom isn't Hawaiian.  Even if she was born in Hawaii, she still wouldn't be Hawaiian. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get her another ring and see if PSVR shows up too
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she start you with the scene that had the grown kid breastfeeding?


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like the girl from The Ring bought a lambo...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While a phone can objectively do more than an old gameboy pushing buttons on touch and actually pushing buttons is a mile apart even without nostalgia. Recently my niece who used to play on her moms iPhone a lot of emulated Pokemon after seeing me play it on my NintendoDS said it's nowhere near as fun as playing it on a real Gameboy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Why is it called a GameBOY? Why can't it be called Gameboygirl?"

-asshat girl on the bottom right 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
About 7 minutes in;

"not official Sega Rom hackers who make the game easier, for you know, kids 'n women, and people who like the Nintendo Wii"

Hello burn ward? I'd like to book a room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Karen ?! .... The girl with that Nintendo thing ? NO DON'T INVITE HER PLEASE
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The same Nintendo that makes you buy the same vC game on each system? Or whereven my wife couldn't keep her ambassador games when switch her ds
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she could use a little more Pokemon go   
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a noob, why didn't she use Protect? A true Pokemon trainer knows this? Pokemon 101! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First, hold your camera the right way. Second, she's not playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just a girl to look at me like Xbox girl is looking at PS guy...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You go to her father's house and swap her for 40 gallons of pesticide.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Next they find her phone showed a ghost pokemon.
Nintendo is going too far.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mother is almost 56 and she knows all there is to know, surface-wise at least. I'm so proud :')
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
your mom told me to tell u she's proud of u
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually no, she kills him after she was already born and raised by comstock in almost every timeline. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because there has never been a story about a guy and girl or father daughter trying to make it through the world before the last of us...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For what it's worth, my Mum made me these (and a Pok√©ball) and I'm sure she'd be happy to take commissions:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Make her open the box. And that's the way you do it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The second game was way better. Just put a lady in whatever house and give her money and make as many children as you can. 

Then one day all the kids get in your way and you go on a killing rampage and then your wife gets in the way then your children are taken by the guards.

And then you try again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now I've gotta go and look up that story about the mom who played Animal Crossing and left a bunch of stuff for her son.

____________________ TOPIC 10 ______________________________

Zarya and Junkrat, altough after having played Ana, she might replace Junkrat.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every single line the bikini girls say is an innuendo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Moira was like nails on a chalkboard

I actually liked her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TBH, this is tame compared to what I've seen.

In my experience, when a girl player reveals herself the team she's on always goes out of their way to help her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm very competitive as well, if I have a child, I'd probably not let him or her win, much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His face is only like that because he was about to rank up and she ruined the match for everyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know right. I tried to show her overwatch and dota. Not a great starting point
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only reason she was standing up was because she was nailed there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seems like she'd be able to do it. You *know* she can aim. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pharah can't do that because she is insanely susceptible to good snipers. Hanzo and widowmaker can take her out of the sky ridiculously easy. If we are talking high skills games where everyone is good with the hero they are playing pharah will not be playing in a "assasin" style. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
also, dont leave your mercy behind.  
also, when mercy is around just stand there and shoot. they will/ should focus her before you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes it was. They guy was like "I have a 4 year old girl who loves to watch the trailer, and I don't want her sticking out her booty. Totally okay with her shooting people though."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In theory? Are you saying you don't know any ordinary, sane women?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the tip of the day goes to this guy/girl/genderless being. Right here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks more like the girl that does her VA now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It looks like that so the player can still see the character he's/she's controlling, are you serious?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's my guess as well, I think she's imagining him in the trailer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D.va can also nullified hanzo‚Äôs ult with her E skill
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got a widowmaker to switch hero after i killed her that way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is called No Man's Sky, so it is obviously the woman's sky.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You say you made it for her, but I think you made it for yourself, *winky face*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder what the percentage is on players with a male character vs. players with a female one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really cannot spot the third one in part 3, where's she hiding?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she finds antibiotics, she pops the top, downs the entire bottle, and still succumbs to infection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whoa there! 

I've got her in my sights ( Õ°¬∫ Õú ñ Õ°¬∫)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she hook all that shit up? That's what I'm talking about! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That chic's face says it all.  She knows she's obsolete. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about making 50shield a line of sight thing like zen's orb or lucio's healing? That would make flankers still have the measly 25shield and the those close to her have 50shield. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably to torment the players who grieved her. It's even more heartbreaking seeing her come back and having to work against her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I giggled like a little schoolgirl when 47 popped up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, Team Ninja really fucked with it all, I mean, 5'9 isn't something to scoff at, but that's half a foot from how tall she's supposed to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do her thing and then you have full right to do yours as well. It's a balance .. you give to her and she gives back to you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohhh, so maybe she turned around because the camera was pointed at her and she's trying to cover her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, I'd love to, but I know she'd give me the ‡≤†_‡≤† face
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
2 games as mercy and in one I got 4man ress. It was potg. Played ~15h this weekened ( ~120 games ) and there were at least 5 mercy potgs. At least in my games she got it more often than other supports. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Noo. That male players would ultimately be better than female players. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't tell how good it is without seeing her face. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To me the best part is the last female at the end that gets blasted across the park.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, thats kind of what widowmaker is supposed to do. pick off people to lighten the burden for the team when pushing the point. if she tries to push the point she'll just get mowed down almost instantly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also if he sees an enemy Mercy Rez her team he'll ask why it worked for them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because Katy Perry let me Aladeen all over her face!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure someone on the Football/Basketball team already has her covered.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's really encouraging. I can see the JOI on her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It can't be girls either play cod with their cleavage popping our or hearthstone also with their cleavage popping out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I was mistaken when he starts talking about Johnny's girl. 

And I will laddie!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goomba means friend in italian and Gooma means mistress.(lady friend)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well either way she is a shit team player a banana could literally support the team better than she can
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the optimistic insinuation at the end that she'll be able to pull that switch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is totally gaming right? her gaming skills are incredible!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just counter him with Moonraker Elite (b)...the girl is Oddjob-short for some reason.

____________________ TOPIC 11 ______________________________

...so she has her baby right there on the lawn?

Seems a bit...primordial...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this a hint for you to dress up like Link and give her the sausage?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It will be like a woman holding as baby cheetah?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should of rolled your eyes and said "heh, don't flatter yourself" give her something to think about 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would make sense if she got skittles with lime.  The green apple is terrible.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Do you ever wonder what if ~~Zelda~~ *Link* was a girl?

Zelda is a girl; she's the princess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She did To the Moon's [soundtrack]( as well! I love her work!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, we have no way of knowing what happened before we saved her. In any of the games. Let that sink in.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to put my Master Sword in her pedestal.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the one where you *can* kidnap her and give her to her stalker
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would detonate that shit right before she lays the last dynamites
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why not just get the rights to use Linkle? There, now we don't have to make girl Link.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she masters that then she will be ready to move onto level 2,  hogan's alley.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I had a girlfriend once. That's how I got the scar on my face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
woah man to much skin is showing near her eyes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or you could say she's turning into a Super Saiyan!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her defense, Link directly caused the downfall of Hyrule by stupidly gathering all the spiritual stones into the temple of time, just like what Ganondorf needed to do. Then he disappeared for ten fucking years. When he shows up again, Zelda finds out he's been engaged to the Zora princess.

She has a fucking right to be cold to him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha, the Zelda bit was my favourite. I speak French, so I'll translate for you:

Zelda: "OH YEAH, DO ME HARD, ZELDA!"

Link: "NO! FUCK, MY NAME'S LINK! Zelda's a girl's name, and you're Zelda...you do this all the time; it's annoying..." :(

Zelda: "IF I TELL YOU YOU'RE ZELDA, YOU'RE ZELDA, OKAY?!"  &gt;:(

*SMACK*

Link: ...."Okay...I'm a princess! I'm your princess! SAVE ME! Heeheeheehee!" :3

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I mean she's kidnapped by glowey eye weirdos that have tree branches grow out of their head. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
how do you think it feels to touch a woman?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just fired up this machine today to start a Zelda marathon with my girlfriend. Awesome little machine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Zelda, not link, actually made an awesome guy. So, why couldn't link make an awesome girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Showed mine Portal, she got very confused and gave up no matter how much I wanted to play...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't even think it's first... The other one doesn't seem to move at all. Her head just moves with her eye
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell your roommate I think she's pretty for a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just use Kilik and smack her in the face with my pole.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how the redhead actually stops to look at what just happened to her friend. Just that momentary look of disbelief before her face smacks into the top of a lamp-post.

There is no amount of preperation for her inbox. Its gone forever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Step back she's going to do a super hero landing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just stare deep into Link's eyes as you penetrate her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We all wish your girlfriend would do that for us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow that red makes her eyes look so awesome and green!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't Shani point out in Hearts of Stone, that a soldier's adventuring days would've been over, if she hadn't treated his knee?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Im not sure if she has colored contacts or just different lighting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wanted to say Zelda, but it must be tiring being her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can someone photoshop the name under her hand so that she's touching an F?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's more of an argument that Zelda has to be female than that Link has to be male.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe not, but she was laying it on pretty thick with the whole ["Come over Mario, I baked a cake for you"]( schtick. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Link's Awakening she's only mentioned by name, right in the very start when Link confuses Marin for her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that even a guy? The little part of the face that's seen reminds me of Loserfruit (a girl).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this is what it looks like if Zelda were a girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd do that but I think my wife would be pretty pissed if I crashed while she was playing Mario...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does it link to a picture of a woman holding a baby leopard cub?!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We spoon for a while, then she's like, "K get the fuck off of me I'm going to sleep."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a picture of a woman holding like a baby leopard 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like they gave her an automated lobotomy or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Link always comes to Zelda's aid. Without saying a word, he has pledged his sword to her. Ipso facto, it's her sword.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I knew a girl named Kirsten who used to play it. 

First hint to my childhood that girls played games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Put a baby in her. Point and say, top that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on mobile and all I can see is a woman holding a baby leopard.

I was helena because i love her and she will marry me one day
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how anti Trump supporters say he'll cause a nuclear war and anti Hillary supporters say she would've caused one.

What I don't love is seeing politics in a gaming subreddit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should I break up and then marry her again? I'm confused.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If a hot guy and a hot girl talk, they must fuck. It is written.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, her assets were much more emphasized back then . . .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't want to vote for trump but if it's between that woman and him.......
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one who thinks she should marry Zangief? I want to see the babies!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sounds like Liara was more forgiving than Ashley was lol, she wasn't havin it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just keep getting her salads and next year she'll dance  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not. I'm not a supporter but she hasn't talked about this in years. It was a major talking point a decade ago. Now it's just more bullshit to harass her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you send her a message on etsy? I can't really speak for her you know? 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she did private parties in costume she could make a killing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"He threatened to kill me in public"

"Why would he want to kill you in public?"

"I think she means: He threatened, in public, to kill her."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are no female soldiers in BF1. There is one Bedouin chick in the campaign, which is historically accurate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus this needs more hot guys. 

Lots of hot girls.

One okay guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell do you mean she has an egg?!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it OK wanting to marry another woman if you're married already?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They weren't when she made this speech back in 2005
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how in the end she has lost all will to move
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She supported Jack Thompson.

This is why if I was American I would never vote for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of reasons Hillary lost. 

She lost because she was unpopular. 

She lost because low turnout. 

She lost because the electoral college. 

She lost because trump promised to bring jobs back to the rust belt. 

She lost because historically it's hard for a party to hold the office for more than 8 years. 

Ultimately it doesn't matter. She lost, but the good thing about democracy is we get to vote again. As Obama said... The sun will come up tomorrow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clinton's popular vote is far ahead of Trump, besides she's not doing the work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While Serana's important, so.

(plus I've always wanted to marry her but you know)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hila is the girl married to Ethan Klein, you're thinking of Halal
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has advocated invading countries like Libya with soldiers.  No one takes her stances on violence seriously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The girl isn't hot at all. This is documentation of a guy giving up in life. Why do people find this to be anything other than sad?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about we have one with Hillary where you take out the emails from her chest 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunately, even winning those wouldn't have won her the election since Trump won PA and FL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd at least try and skullfuck the crazy out of her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she wants it, she can have it, but she can't bring her own.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would say Marry her but it appears you already did
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do. It would be ridiculous to include female soldiers in a WWI game. Just like it would be ridiculous not to include the French in a WWI game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He won because he received more electoral votes based on the states he took. More Americans voted for Clinton and she lost. That is a flawed system that needs to be looked at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can fuck girls your whole life but your mind is only sharp enough to dunk nerds for a few years. /s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Member when marriage was between a man and a woman? Ooohh I member!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or at least she was back in 2005 when she made that speech.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes. Trump is a bigot. His supporters if not bigots them selves, which lets be honest they are, support bigotry be supporting Trump. He is the public face of the private gop meetings. 

Not to say Clinton is any better she's a criminal. An amoral sociopath with one goal in mind sitting in the oval office regardless of how our what happens after. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I'm pretty sure that the far right one in the middle is just her character from Hot Fuzz.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are already war games with male/female characters so I don't think that would've been a thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she did win the vote so it isn't a democracy. It's an oligarchy, accept it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she actually won and the losing side is salty
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't look playful, she looks like a flamingo. Flamingos are not known for being playful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why isn't this getting more upvotes? Because it's not a hot girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Were they ever sued by amy winehouse for using her likeness? She would've won.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only if Hillary "Slav Slayer" Clinton is elected (she won't be).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[I was wondering if she'd get hired for another restoration. Good for her.](

Member when marriage was between a man and a woman?


I member
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a moose nuckle on a hot woman. I never thought I'd see that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Step 1: Be an attractive female.

Step 2: Get really fucking dirty.

Step 3: You did it!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she just want to hand a bunch of votes to Trump? Because this is how you hand a bunch of votes to Trump.

She's just jealous that he's rocking it better than her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sugar for diabetes and video games for a sedentary lifestyle. You know she is secretly trying to kill you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i can't co-op necrodancer for the life of me :( but i think it's because im way better at it than the person im playing it with. not to be a snob.. it's just i have no life and she works all the time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now your going to need another because she isn't gonna give that one up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's really cool! Good work! My girlfriend made me a few one time, some of my favorites were a Majora's Mask and Gengar.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The blood on her looks so carefully applied, needs more random.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is it zooming in on her knees?

I don't get it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And *this*, ladies and gentlemen, is why Exodia is banned at tournaments.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're gonna get her a fucking Porsche Cayenne for her 11th
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is it that no spamerino chick?
Why do people care? If you dont like her, dont watch her. Its easy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Still have her halo one on my wall! So cool
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what you call "excellent defilade fire," ladies and gentlemen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd want her in my wigwam if you know what I'm saying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is link a girl? not into flying airships and wacky stuff like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually never got this meme... ELI5 ? Who is this girl ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guys. If you look very carefully you can see her bum.

shes nuttier than a fruitcake if you care to look her up

Oh she needs to fuck right off with tht shit. Closeminded bullying is not what will help the problem she is trying to fix.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But it's still a problem if the field is *perceived* as unwelcoming from the outside because women won't attempt to get into the field in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Leave that girl. If you stay, you're in a for a roller coaster of emotions for your future.

"Kenny please. At least I don't get beaten up by a girl and then get killed"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So a game that encourages you to go outside and walk around and exercise comes out and this girl decides to sell fucking potato chips?! That tells me a couple things about her. 

1. She doesn't know any alternatives. Why not try selling some healthy options? Options that will actually make you full for longer?

2. Her parents did not and are not raising her right. She is clearly misinformed and going down a very bad path already.

Childhood obesity is a HUGE fucking problem and to just ignore it probably makes you worse in this situation.

Well I mean nobody *needs* games, but I think it will be less than 15 years before he starts to miss them.  And yes, you are right, I can barely believe some of the choices my ex makes.  I mean she's got almost complete kidney failure (a hereditary problem that she had plenty of time to expect) and will probably require a transplant or daily dialysis within a few more years, yet she continues to smoke a pack a day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope, it's not. But the situation could have been avoided in the first place if she hadn't goaded Kenny into flipping out. It was obvious that Kenny had a problem, but maybe they could have tried to resolve the situation some other way than "Hey Clem, watch this, I'm gonna prove that Kenny gets dangerously mad by making him dangerously mad!"

Also, when does Jane commit suicide?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly. Generally speaking women did not fight at all in WW1. If you add in women, its a huge disrespect to the millions of men who gave their lives for their countries.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Indeed. Obviously, the only solution is to kill them, bury their corpses in the woods and become a hermit living on Mt Fuji.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't know shit about abusive relationships. 

Mostly what makes a woman stay with a scumbag like that is fear, insecurity and brainwashing. It's not only physical abuse, It's mental too, and that's the real problem. The wounds may heal but the mental issues takes longer treatment.

The vast majority of cases like this leads to nothing because of the fear the woman has to confront a situation like telling relatives or telling it to the authorities. Most of them are not even aware that they are being abused.

Your comment is completely ignorant.

"...danger to women and children"

The mental gymnastics Jesus

If you have such a problem with it, then don't play games. Everyone gets harassed, everyone is told to drink bleach and get cancer, no doubt you as a female experience more of this, but hell everyone gets this shit.
If you don't like it, then don't play. Or find a group of people to play with.

Snoo is a girl GODDAMNIT! DOES NOBODY GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE RULES ANYMORE?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the consequences of being distracted are greater - i.e she's left tied up...

Who does she think she is, Superman? Cause this is how you become one.

Sometimes people switch things up. You're seeing a snapshot. I agree if she's going out every weekend and he stays at home, it's not looking good. But given his shitty choice of alone-vegging game, I doubt he has much experience at this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tough, but she did break the rule that was clearly posted. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He was using the force to probe into her mind. But turns out she had latent force powers as well. This made the connection between them a two way link revealing their deepest secrets / fears to each other.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used to have trouble with that but after I got my current gf I just ask her what I should make my character look like. It helps keep her interested when I decide to play, me giving her choices over certain things I do in-game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seems fair. I have a deep hatred for Mae that simply killing her cannot quench. I hate her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to play characters who are on some level emotionally vulnerable.
For example I really connected with my Geralt of Rivia due in part to the emotional struggles that he faced, which is one of my favorite aspects of the game.

I also like female protagonists, because that allows for a different dynamic in some ways.

Puts an unfair burden on you? You're both married with the agreement to be with each other, not to dictate what life someone can have, you joiend each other because of love and you get benefits (and sex) from that and possibly kids. Maybe she wants to travel the world as it's her life long dream,  maybe she wants to go back toc ollege to get a graduate degree, maybe she has a serious medical issue, or maybe she gets depressed clinically, perhaps still she's lost her job and it's taking a lot of time in this corporate corrupt environment to get something for her, who knows.

You are MARRIED, you are not together with an adult, you are unified. And in any case she has the sex in her hands, she should in all forms have the ability to influence you more than you're willing to admit or comfortable with.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah, except society doesn't teach men that their value lies in the way they look to the same extent that it does for women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like she is being forced to use the gun and she isn't ready, but she wants to act like she is. Maybe slightly handicapped given her age and the situation
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah, rather badly worded

Anyways, in a better way of saying it, watching you succeed where she constantly fails probably isn't a good idea
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you relay a message please? Tell her I think her work is really fucking good, I just cant justify paying that much for a blanket. Im not Kanye West. Though, I hope she can find an easier route thats more financially fiesable. Even so her work is great to look at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Technically, yeah. I mean they kind of made it work, but it was all because of a MacGuffin. The *only* reason that they needed to free Anakin from slavery using the podrace was because they found the one guy in the entire galaxy that was immune to force persuasion.

Even worse than that, Qui-Gon even demonstrated that there were other alternatives when he influenced the chance cube to make it so that Anakin would be the one freed not his mother. If he was able to influence the world around Watto without him noticing then surely he could have figured out a way to free Anakin (and his mother?!) from slavery without, you know, risking the life of a child in an incredibly deadly race.

Or, perhaps since slavery is a moral wrong as well as being illegal in the Galactic Republic (of which Tatooine was an outlying planet, but still a part) they could have simply seized Anakin (and his mother) and left.

They had plenty of opportunity as Anakin and Mom lived separately from Watto and Qui-Gon and friends are allowed free access to them. It would not have seemed excessive for a Jedi to simply enforce the moral right and free the slaves.

Now some may respond by pointing out that they needed Watto to give them a part for their ship and that *that* was another reason that the pod race was necessary, but there were other solutions to that as well.

First off there is simply the solution of force. Between two Jedi and the Queen's security forces they could have simply taken it. Perhaps this doesn't seem very 'Jedi' like, but doesn't it? If there is one thing that the prequels taught us it is that the Jedi are not above placing the greater good above all else. Moreover, they are on a mission that is essential to the security of the galaxy and Qui-Gon thinks they just found space Jesus in the form of Anakin (turns out he might not have been right, but he thought he was) so a little force doesn't seem that out of the question.

But even if Qui-Gon would have been unwilling to do that there were still other solutions:

He could have threatened to turn Watto in to the Galactic authorities for slavery (which again it is made clear is illegal). Something along the lines of, "you are giving us the part, the only question is if you will be coming with us to face slavery charges, give it to us peacefully and we'll let you stay here. Make us take it from you and you'll be coming with us and tried for slaving". The Jedi are basically a Galactic police force after all. I mean they more or less say that when Mace Windu says that they *aren't* an army but are just a peace keeping force. Here are two Jedi that are witnessing not only a crime, but a human rights violation. They should probably do something about it.

Or, they are flying the Queen's ship. I know they left in a hurry, but presumably it was pre-stocked with goods. Just look at her ridiculous wardrobe. Surely there was *something* on that ship worth bartering with.

Or they could have combined some of these. Perhaps they use the force to make the Queen's wardrobe look more valuable than it is to trade it for the ship part and Anakin and then also sneak his mother out at night.

All that to say as /u/radicalation put it, the pod racing scene was awesome, but why was it necessary? Pretty much only so that we could see an awesome pod racing scene. There were so many other, better, and safer options that they could have pursued.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bull... They were going to off her to see if there was a chance that it might do some good... they didn't have the resources to make it happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like it would be a reply from Vegan Gains current girlfriend, Bill Gates. Wouldn't put a ring on that, stay far, far away folks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That strap is perfectly positioned to push up her bewbs. 

Mmmm.

Bewbs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For starters, it means that we live within the limitations of the simulation. 

This could mean any number of things. It could mean we have a slower speed of light, or that technologies which are possible outside the simulation aren't possible inside. What if quick travel between stars isn't as far fetched as it sounds, it's just that the physical laws of our simulation don't allow for it? What if our atoms are coarser than 'real' atoms, hence limiting our ability to make technologies such as nanomachines and microprocessors past a certain scale?

Those kinds of things would definitely limit the scope of our civilization compared to what a 'real' one would be capable of achieving in their reality.


The most horrifying thing about being inside a simulation is that THERE IS A GOD. That's right, somebody, some man, woman, or something in between, or maybe even a whole team of them, has complete and total control over every aspect of our reality. I have no reason to believe they aren't a billion times smarter and wiser than your average human being, but I can sure as hell tell you one thing, *I would never want someone with the mind of man as I know it to be in control of reality*. That's a BAD combination.

And here's a thought... What if our universe HAS a purpose?

Great! Right? Wrong.

What happens when that purpose is fulfilled? How do we have any way of even knowing what that purpose is? The most arbitrary action could spell the end of our universe if it sates the intellectual curiosities of whoever runs the show. Maybe the whole point is to watch the first child born in 2045 pick their nose, and then it just shuts down? I mean, who knows if this simulation is even unique, they could have a thousand simulations running simultaneously just for the purpose of simulating random climax events and then ending all of history and starting new with a new scenario.

The bottom line is that it's just plain terrifying to think of intelligence as we know it having any manner of control over a whole universe, because intelligence as we know it can have any number of arbitrary reasons to do  whatever it is it decides to do. The nice thing about our universe, if it is real, is that based on everything we've observed we can still predict what's going to happen, and even when. If intelligence of any kind were to have influence, who knows how it could echo throughout the universe. The most cursory change could throw off all of our knowledge and predictive models leaving us in the dark.  
  
**edit: tl;dr intelligence having control over reality is a bad**

If you play more like a renegade with her feelings, she will duck your brains out and then never really open up to you. It doesn't really develop into a relationship either. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll probably meet my woman in college Anyway.

Planing on studying software development.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agreed, women being generally selfish and stubborn makes for a frustrating situation for anyone to deal with. 

I will blame the woman 100% of the time &lt;3
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So you thought it was suicide?  And the guy there was just making sure she followed through with her decision? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What was the end result of this anyway? I come back and read through the thread now and then but I never learned what became of this woman and her "game".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The problem is that he-man picture is also heavily used by people like /u/xTRYPTAMINEx who don't want to help men, but just shut down and conversation about women.

If you want to help men, bring up the mens topics on their own, don't raise them as a counterpoint to women's issues. We need to fix all of it, but if the issues are different, there's no point in trying to tackle them simultaneously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its a responsive in the nature of the community that loved her. Would you rather that no one cared?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope she proves everyone wrong and it detonates and causes a portal rift to open into another dimension and then we successfully meet aliens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, lots of people backed out  because they were quite controlling over their content creators and wanted a significant share of their earnings while retaining copyright for other people's content. Also the CEO allegedly once raped a female youtuber.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think that's why people voted for her. Nobody really liked her, it was more about let's avoid putting a narcissistic man child in a really important position. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and assuming it's a narrative reason. What's one of the most common devices to take down your boss? Ally with the group trying to bring them down and work as an informant/agent. You were likely disarmed by the guards as a requirement to meet her, then the guard (your ally) pretends to threaten you. That's their plan to get you re-armed without getting him killed in the process. 

This is all just guesswork but it makes a lot more sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  she could theoretically remove the chance of impregnation if she activated her ability quickly enough; a 'post-nut' defence mechanism,

The female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I follow this girl and her sister on deviantart.  I'm pretty sure they know a lot of different folk with individual talents, and I believe they had the sword specially made by a blacksmith friend of theirs.  They go by the name [love-squad](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based off of my import Saturn she got me recently.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
even though this is stupid as fuck she has good presentation skills
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I get that you're playing devil's advocate, but what you're advocating for is a slippery slope of privilege and oppression bullshit where everyone is trying to prove what a fucking victim they are.

There is plenty of bad shit that is worse for men than it is for women, but nobody gives a fuck because men are apparently just supposed to deal with their problems like adults.  Well so should women.  In fact all adult humans should deal with their problems like adult humans; imagine that.

Also it's up to individual people to separate their fantasy from their reality.  If someone is really driven to the types of behaviour you suggest because of exposure to some tits in a video game, then there are bigger issues at play.

He gets him all the secret developer cheats that make the girl characters clothes fall off, but they only work for him.  You have to have a special console.

I have bunch of female friends. And I'd hit every single one, I maybe aren't actively looking for it but given the chance I wouldn't back down.

It's worth noting that Cortana chose Noble 6 before she chose Chief.

As far as the lore goes Noble 6 was better, faster and more skilled. What he didn't have was Chief's luck. After Noble 6's death Cortana opted for the luckiest rather than the best.

It's also worth noting that many other Spartans were demonstrably better or more skilled than Chief too. He was however a great leader, and an incredibly lucky soldier making it through situations time and again that he absolutely should not have.

Because she mentioned she dislikes her breasts when compared to another woman. Right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you read the books? I quite like her. I mean, Geralt is my favorite fictional character. The whole series is really about Ciri. And Geralts adventures trying to find her. Kinda like Witcher 3!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her Yen ones and that girl from got is really good. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cuteness overload. Maybe she wasn't as confused by the teaser as I was!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But people are weenies and there is a girl so they might get a boner. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The smiling girl was the only redeeming thing in this 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never played witcher, played witcher 2, and will never stop playing wit her 3.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All I can see when I look at her is the fingers... I cannot un-see them.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's weird. No one ever really talks about this game, just the girl from it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree.....  Time to let her go. Is that mine sweeper?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can see it too.  Geralt has women throwing themselves at him all the time.  It's no surprise that he'd show interest in the one who rejects his advances.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not surprised seeing Gerald of Riva with yet another woman. Triss/Yen sure are forgiving... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's why many girls think Paris and Venice are romantic when actually they are just overpriced holes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; but who really cares about how she acts with Ciri?

geralt?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That annoyed me so much I chose to kill her off on Vermire from then on because I didn't want her to think I wanted her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a terrible idea though, the baddies could just tune in and see where she is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish I was a cute girl so I could wear them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know. I understand that in the books Yen and G are very close but only having played W3 it seems like she's blatantly using him... then again just about every other character in the game is too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And that makes sense, guys get aroused, etc by seeing while girls do that by what they read, hear, etc. So games as a visual art will always be "biased" towards men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yen is love, yen is life. Geralts awkward compliments around her are the best.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what she wants you to think. Actually her character in W3 is a bit too much of a Pollyanna, but in the books and the Witcher 1 and 2 she's totally a Femme Fatale.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ciri ~~C~~ C~~i~~iri

Cir~~i~~

Ciril~~l~~la

Cir~~i~~lla

Cirilla

Fio~~n~~na

Fiona

Ciri Cirilla 

Ele~~n~~ Ria~~n~~nnon

Elen Ria~~n~~nnon

Elen Riannon

It's Ciri (Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon) attempting to write her own name, and not having very much luck. Glagolitic script is quite difficult to write with, even if you just substitute English letters for the Glagolitic script like CDPR have done. Presumably they have a different alphabet in Skellige and Cintra. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I changed the L4D witch sounds to her voice. Made coming back to the game after a year both confusing and hilarious.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I just killed her and I agree, I fucking lost it when I went into the trapdoor as Dandelion and then seeing Geralt's reaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's my favorite line from the books. Magnificent writing she does.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, just Ciri describing a world she hid from the hunt, which is pretty identical to Cyberpunk 2077's world. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does that girl look so derpy in the screenshots. I'll stick with Witcher 3s Triss/Yen kthx. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to see her as Arkum Harley Quinn. Her facial expressions are on point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just need more GLaDOS. Every line from her is great. Makes me smile every time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she is, in ME3 :P and that goodbye at the end is my favorite ;_;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How the hell do you know she's cute? Can't see shit maan

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whenever I see her I read the text in her dopey voice. Watch indigo league if you don't know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For some reason I feel like this was written in the women's restroom
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish she had "Please do the needful" in her script somewhere. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I read this as "This guy made a game to prolapse to his girlfirend." I don't even know why I read it like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not saying she doesn't have a cute face but I would like to see her with the mask on... is that weird?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is a pro at catching her, terrible at keeping her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on my second play through, so far I've been a dick to Yen and had sex with Keira then killed her, I don't know what I am doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The female voice actor is way better, I think. The male voice is boring as fuck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't know who the fuck she was... I just thought she looks like Geralt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How lucky can one guy be? I kissed her and she kissed me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good thing she never watched you play to see what you were actually doing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean... you could game for *fewer* than 8 hours at a time. You could go for a walk! Or read a book! Or meet a girl!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aisha Tyler, and yes she did it on her own and the article doesn't make it seem like they were overall happy about it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lets dispense with this fiction that she doesn't know what she's doing.  She knows exactly what shes doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping I wasn't the only one really annoyed by her voice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This would explain why the voice acting in Bethesda's games can be... uninspiring. Imagine what a difference it would make if a voice actor could really get into a role by knowing a character and his/her motivations. This would be better for the games industry imho.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the only one I didn't bang because I screwed up the conversation the first time I met her. I only had one play-through of ME3
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was confused.  
By the time you meet her again she is back to her normal personality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish dead on included any bit of her silly character or facial expressions

You don't know how that bovine identifies! And though you didn't say it, the implication that all females are cows triggers me.

They'll have two ps4 when she'll be back with him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she just slashed his jaw off, not punched.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really like the new Lara and her look. I also prefer her over the more high-res version of the old one (before the reboot). I think she looks prettier this way and also a lot more believable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Supposedly there is an HD remaster coming for PC/XO/PS4. /r/PS4 has been fangirling pretty hard. Their last open world game wasnt exactly great so they need a replavement.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got them from HillsHeels on Etsy. The owner of the shop is super easy to work with and talk to, and she can do pretty much any design it seems. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can literally see her eyebrows rise just a little bit out of fear.

I see you favor gen 3 and best girl.

I just wish zarya was better. She is by far my favourite character. But I never do well as her because she just feels so weak, especially compared to Rhein. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lara Croft?  I thought she was a zombie from the walking dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should have made a version of that game where she was traversing Dante's Inferno called "Where in the hell is Carmen Sandiego?"

First 4 Laras I'm with you. But her incarnations since the ps2 are not worth playing imo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess. But still as pointed out *she* is younger in the new series than in the old ones.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not how armour or physics works... The main reason is there really wasn't many armoured female Knights trotting around in medieval times.

What should we call this game about a lady who raid tombs?
Tomb raider.
What about the sequels?
Tomb raider.
But we...
TOMB. RAIDER.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Designed by a woman, mind you. In the way Conan was designed by a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I liked Peach best for her hover over toads strength. You still have Gyromite and R.O.B.?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a woman I'm a mix of Pam and Cheryl... like Pam with a choking fetish and tungsten knitting needles...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm all for a female protagonist, but she should look more like a female bodybuilder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is this being downvoted? The tomb raider game in 2013 was a reboot,she's literally younger in this and Rise of the tomb Raider than the original games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
On closer inspection I think he/she has fooled us all. I've dismantled a PS4 controller before and they could easily put that back together.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would have said tomb raider. Way better game and she's soooo hot hehe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man final fantasy is one of my favourite game series ever but my gf of 8 years thinks it's boring :-( she just wants me to play hitman or rainbow six instead of buy this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And if you [e621 Lara Croft]( shit gets truly outrageous.

That's beyond NSFW, by the way. Incognito is probably mandatory. There's no reasonable explanation you could give.

But she's certainly naked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me vs the guy she tells me not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
MineCraft on any platform is great, my girlfriend and I have just started playing it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, again, most male characters in the medium are not designed with real women sexualizing them like women in the medium typically are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just want to point out your straw man argument there. Comparing two same generation consoles is not the same as comparing two random computers. New computers have a tremendous range.

Actually both. The old tomb raider games croft was a badass already.  In these games she isn't. She's no slouch, but she's much more vulnerable,  so it's easier to get tied into the game. The puzzles are great as well, albeit a bit difficult at times.

The problem with that is he can turn it around on her. She would need another angle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is posting a sexualized version of tracer really related to a topic of a non sexualized pose getting removed. If anything this just shows that people like her arse and are pissed that it got removed because they can't wank off to her arse pose. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did the SJWs really say that though? Unless I'm mistaken the "complaint" was simply that they didn't think it fit her character and that plenty of other characters made sexy poses but it was fine for them, and the devs seemed to agree 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That second response is just PR bullshit and you know it. Even IF they believed that this pose doesnt fit her, there is no need to remove it for the people who DO like it.

Add more poses that you think fit her more? Sure, go for it! But dont remove the ones already there because someone on the forum complained about their kid that shouldn't even be playing the game in the first place might actually see her butt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
....or, it could be a guy playing a female character. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think I fit into any of these categories. I've always just played as a female character without even thinking about it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The whole "butts of Overwatch" thing is getting pretty tired out. Yes Overwatch has female characters, yes they have butts. Move along.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha no. Creators can pursue whatever-the-fuck artistic vision that they want. Also, this line of thinking seems to assume attractive/shapely women don't exist in real life.

&gt; Dead or Alive is pretty sexist

No it isn't. It would be sexist if all the female fighters were inherently worse or if someone in the game, at some point, said "women suck." Making the girls sexually appealing is not inherently sexist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's the problem with this pic exactly that labels her as an *instawhore*?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"There's no way a woman would demean herself like that, by doing such a raunchy pose!" Said all the idiots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tifa can do whatever she wants to it. I will not complain.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The issue isn't that she's attractive or that her outfit is potentially sexual, they're not removing her skin tight outfit. She'll still have the same body type, that's not what this is about 

It's not as simple as "looking over her shoulder". Her hips were spread out and she was angled to draw viewer's eyes to her ass. When you look at Hanzo you see the whole character and with Tracer's pose your eyes are drawn straight to her ass, if you follow the perspective that's just where eyes are drawn. And even if Hanzo was sexualized that doesn't mean that Tracer has to be. They want to achieve something else with the character and that's okay. 

I don't know much about the character McCree, but if the character is designed to not have a sexual aspect and the pose does have a focus on sex then maybe it should be removed. However, there are plenty of sexualized characters in the game no one has any problem with. The issue isn't that there are sexualized women, or that men aren't sexualized, or a character like Tracer couldn't conceivably be sexual. The issue is simply that's not what the point of the character is and the pose diluted what they wanted to achieve with her. They decided to change the pose to something else. What is the problem with that? It seems odd to me that this one pose for this one character is so important to anyone. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;the pose but it just doesn't fit Tracer's character.

The pose is just her standing. How does that not fit someone's character? What kind of "character" is one that doesn't include standing? Other than somebody in a wheelchair.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This does not sexualize him though. Please watch Serkesian's video about butt coverage, even though you disagrees with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she's a fictional character, that's why. Why should devs be beholden to how certain people see a character, and not others? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
sex is not defined by physical appearance/expression, though. it's defined by genetics.

and please answer my question: who defined what a female or male brain looks like in the first place?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't you get the memo? Every woman in every game has to be sexualized now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except that the crux of the suggestion, which Kaplan agreed with, wasn't that it was sexy: it was that it didn't seem to fit her character in general. The guy fumbled it a bit by mentioning sex appeal and his daughter, but the crux of it remains: he didn't feel it fit Tracer. That was fucking it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was me replying to *that* comment. But the wider discussion is about how women can/should be portrayed in media - and I'm on the side of "sexy poses are not damaging". 

&gt;Foremost, the creator of this character actually agreed that it doesn't fit her character.

That's what he said, but that's also in direct contrast to what he said *earlier*. Which one do you take as the truth? It shouldn't have been an issue anyway - one person complaining about something as mundane as a *pose* shouldn't have gotten any traction and certainly not a literally game-changing one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, I thought "real women don't exist that look like game characters"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That first pose is no longer Blizzard sanctioned, please let her know she must stop using it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he complained that a sexual pose doesn't fit her character's personality, NOT that the pose was sexual. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that just means you're going to ***gloss over*** what you're really doing and not call it by its name: 

* ***defining the 'right way' of depicting women*** 

:shrugs: 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy who made the original post did mention Widow, they didn't have a problem with them because it was suited to the character. The problem they had with the original Tracer pose was that it was sexualised in a way which didn't fit with her character. Like the new pose might still have her ass in it but the posing is more consistent with her personality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fuck? Alot of people want female characters? I always play one in place of my girlfriend and she always plays a male in place of me. Fucking great like on Divinity Original Sin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she had no real character. Overwatch is not a game with a real narrative
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I can see where you're comming from, and agree completely, there's a Little bit of backstory to this.

Tracer is a hero of the upcoming Blizzard game Overwatch. An user made a post saying he found one of her victory poses to sexualize her, and the game director said he would remove it.

However that created a lot of controversy in the overwatch community because that pose is shared by a lot of characters ( ) and well a lot of senseless drama.

So in this other Blizzard Game, Heroes of the Storm, where Blizzard characters are present and battle each other, they announced Tracer as a playable character at the Spring Championship, and the cosplayer they hired for the event decided to do the pose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your argument can just as easily be applied to having her not show off her ass as well, though.

So if Blizzard decided they don't want Tracer showing off her ass, then that decision should be respected just as well!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I'm glad you know the character better than the people who created her and agreed the pose didn't fit her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; suits her character more.

Four other characters use this pose. So are they all being changed also because they don't fit the "personality" of the video game character?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not into that kind of thing. But I think she is the cutest of the characters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then we got to see her ass as she used an emote, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I asked another friend who knows him better than me and she said to say like 7
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm just wondering why they had her in that pose to begin with? Why that pose specifically? How were they *not* trying to sexualize her? And if they weren't..isn't it worse that they couldn't recognize it? It's now so commonplace to have a woman in that sexual pose that it's not even sexual anymore...it's expected?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I enjoy my butts in gaming I don't want feminists completely removing nice butts from gaming because there demeaning to woman right sure 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's just idiotic. This isn't a real person. This isn't sexualizing a little girl or a family member.

This is a fictional character, it hurts nothing and no one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the "Too sexual, doesn't match her character, must be removed, offensive pose
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i would shove my tongue way up in links ass... oh its a girl?.. whatever would still put my tongue in that ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It looks like she's getting it in the ass for the first time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is so bitchin' man! Your woman is talented. She's a fine artist. 

This totally looks like some character from Rick &amp; Morty. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The obvious ones are people getting upset that women exist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The butt pose controversy was because Tracer's butt pose was out of character. Widowmaker had a pose that was even more, "Hey, look at this butt" and nobody said anything about it because she's the femme fatale character archetype. Given her characterization, there was no real reason for that pose to exist on Tracer. It was replaced with a pose that resembled an oldschool pinup that still featured her butt, but was more in character.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where is the SJW calling this sexist because girls can play video games too?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
only a sexy girl could get away with saying something so overly simplified. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As long as there's no sexy women in video games that is, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
this is one of the dumbest things i've seen in a good long time. if the problem was feminists against sexualizing characters it would have been directed toward all the female characters but it wasn't and it isn't. someone called out blizzard for a lazy design choice and blizzard agreed. you wanna see ass you don't even need to turn off overwatch, just play widowmaker. get the fuck over it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


honestly the pose almost does more for her chest than her butt
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;My problem came from the argument that she cant be sexy because she is funny.

No one made that argument...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the argument that they're making is that men being beef-cakes isn't a problem because men WANT to be beef-cakes in real life. It's an aspirational thing to be able to be one in a video game. The problem feminists have with women in games is that women are little more than cum-dumpsters for men to high-five over at the end. 

*Disclaimer. I'm not on either side of this 'debate' I'm just explaining the argument. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Blizzard didn't remove it because people are complaining, it's because that pose looks like shit on her

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I get that it's immersive, but this girl is a fucking idiot 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For a second, I thought she was cosplaying

  [this]( )\  from Dark Souls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
love how she looks at the worker in the back like its HIS fault
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He just hates women and found the moment to shine
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope, you're just a stupid little shit who's into 55 years old women.

I'd brag about neither if I were you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guys!!!! Guys!!! Wait......Member when marriage was just between and man and a woman???
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Waiting for her head to fit the rift...

wat
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a stupid fucking question. Fuck her right in the pussy! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A girl who owns at Dark Souls is wife material.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just load up Dark Souls 1 and tell her it's supposed to be easy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just talking? The game lets you do a lot more than just "talking" to girls... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you get that a lot from the ladies

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 *proceeds to hit that woman repeatedly for 193,746 times and feeling light* 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Crush your enemy, impress corporate, see them driven before you, get that promotion, hear the lamentations of their women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what the heck....     
i got touched like this by women too, on my working place. it's like nothing, unless it doesn't disturbs your work or what ever it is even funny.       


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Back in the day my girl loved watching me play GTA San Andreas. We played it so much it got to the point we would sing along to certain songs on the radio.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait... you said to your girlfriend "I'll never fill that up!"??? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But people also go to clubs because their friends want to go and because they enjoy the music. I personally don't like clubs, so my girlfriend goes without me. She doesn't cheat on me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
U respect her by showing up to a digital place in a video game?

U see the idiocy of this yes?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like a better question would be "who gives a fuck if she is or not?" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Eh, she doesn't do much. Maybe as Ron or Dave?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is there anyway to get her songs on the pip boy radio?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You realize they light up a sign that tells people to clap right?

Yall are as dumb as these ladies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why is this in gaming? 

People from r/gaming don't go to clubs or have girlfriends who go to clubs. Unless you mean like d&amp;d clubs or Comicon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't really look like she can even make it to the end of her street
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who called them obscure? 
And you literally have to type on Google the answer and it'll tell you. So to answer your question, no she doesn't listen to Slayer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i didnt get to hear the whole thing, did she break up with him because of that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's outrageous! What do you think, guys? Should we kill her?

^^/s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean, did she have 'avid listeners' before that song?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a lucky guy. If my woman played dark souls with me, I would never not be erect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That actually was news to me. I watch a 2 year old and she pretty much has it down. I guess accidents happen though
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend doesn't want the new Zelda game because she thinks it looks too much like Dark Souls. I think she is crazy because it doesn't look enough like Dark Souls

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It did look like she was going for a swing at him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, Calcifer. That's what you say to all the pretty ladies. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was watching the way I did it and yes, would you believe, she was blowing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is anyone in her homeroom class? Can you ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend yes/no/maybe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, she knows it's a multipass. Anyway, we're in love.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Almost like she should be part of the "In the Dark" Brotherhood....ba dum psshhhhh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never said it wasn't a girl, just used "guys" without thinking
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Besides singing it, she didn't really have much to with making the song.

____________________ TOPIC 20 ______________________________

Well, I'm sure the "average" part is subjective, you may not find yourself that attractive

But your girlfriend probably does
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's because he's going to backdoor her when she does not expect it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
too bad she's kinda ugly, but at least got the booty...so i guess congrats 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And did they butcher her name and call her "Laura" instead?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aww someone took the attention away from her. Attention seeking brat. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know it was not the spoons what draw you to her thighs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So... /r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG?

But no, I did honestly think her attention to detail was really good.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women will come up with names for all of them

Women: "Cerulean Grey", "Butterscotch Grey", "Spring Grey"

Men: "Grey", "Grey", "Dark Grey"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he was a pretty girl this would be considered attention-whoring. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah Nicki Minaj is quite the Puritan in her music videos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her name is Tara Babcock and she has a twitch stream and youtube channel. 

In all honestly she's pretty intelligent and keeps it real in her youtube videos (like her tutorial on lighting tips for a stream)

But yes, also boobs. Hooray!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it is called hitman and not hitwoman so wot does he expect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will if she keeps giving me dirty looks :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now she can easily stream all of her favorite obnoxious minecraft youtubers! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost as if women can be beautiful or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah I was just joking.  I was just saying that's what she pretty much did instead of doing something smart with it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who is this? A famous cosplayer? Never seen her before. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even see her adams apple until I looked at it again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some people just won't admit they get turned on by animation. I know tons of guys who make it a point to call out people who find "fake" girls attractive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bah, you know he is just faking interest in video games to get her attention, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she was obviously hired by someone to dress like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because a chick dresses as a video game character that happens to be skimpy, doesn't mean she is some attention whore. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
only le witcheroo threesome can have females that match this pure quality
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahahaha! Only an attention harlot would be mad about that, but come on, we are talking about beautiful women who dress up like video game characters, so who's surprised?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Obsession with women of the WWE? Now youre just making things up. I have no time for blatant liars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it's drawn at school, I expect you to receive a call notifying you of her expulsion. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No I think okay video games women obvious course yes.  

It just parts of me thinks this more attention seek than game love, yes?  Confuse as to who objectify who and who dress up game for.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is crappy. You will be better off, and she didn't deserve your time. Game on.

You'll find a good player 2 eventually.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, saying a girl has double D's could be a compliment too, but if she's sporting A cups, then it's still not true.  You just wanted to use that gif.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not only is the work she did amazing but that collection of games is also amazing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was a little anti climactic. I was expecting you to throw her off the ledge..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would be great if she was like Catalina in GTA3/SA. Just a crazy psychopath like the rest of the protagonists.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's got the bunny ears. She's ready for her own Twitch channel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I asked her which is her favorite. she said all of them! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, I'm telling you I think she's attractive.   That would make me the pedophile in your world.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then she gets that one and he's back to the average
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend is getting into gaming and she is playing this right now. She loves the beauty of the game the most.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Set her up a twitch! Then put donations into a college fund!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played a girl bunny?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This kind of love is my favorite. She loves that it was put up by you, and it has meaning to you, so it had meaning to her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly, men only ever take women out to get their 'balls on their jigglies...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it me or are the girls that dress up for these conventions always hot.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah man she's just trying to get back from [Davy Jones' Locker](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Play Mercy because girl and get views because girl

&gt;Play other characters as guy but get no views because average skill

FTFY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like that inflating woman ball game that used to be in arcades.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gravis/Breitbart has her up +4
Fox has her up +7
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not good enough, I want to see her use Morph Ball 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do girls like this even play videogames or do they just want attention?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is one of many criticisms. There's no *one* thing that she's done which deserves the most criticism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is great. Now, how many women on twitch will make this ?

____________________ TOPIC 21 ______________________________

My girlfriend is the same way...she spend 2 hours creating a character on DkS1 only to never make it out of the undead asylum...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's why I have a mutt. Healthy, will live forever, and she was free. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My friend is still running a 6850 and she even played TW3 on it. It wasn't even that great of a card in its time, which was what, 2010-2011?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or sell them for what they're worth and tell her you got 60$. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got my first bj 15 years ago today. Her name was K**** and her tits were massive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Took my lady shopping in seattle for xmas. 

Wanna spend 100$ on eyelash crap from sefora? Merry Christmas 
50$ nordstrom scarf?screw it 
Wouldnt even go in there. It's like tjmax thought it was a boutique 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you probably don't have a girlfriend because you use xD unironically
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What made me ask is that my girlfriend bought me a DBZ hoodie a while ago and the picture of Goku that was on the front faded after about a couple months. Made me a little sad.

Maybe this technique will give me more time with my next DBZ hoodie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she has only used it once, wasn't good at any of the games, and I already own a working NES with over 60 games  (almosy all are in the Classic).

And we're trying to buy a house so an extra $150 instead of something we don't use would be great. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, it is, they've said that already. 

And it runs all the games she plays just fine. She's 10, she's not going to be doing 3D modeling. It'd be stupid to spend money on new parts for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that "someone" was being a dick and they decided that he or she will get a cheap sweaters instead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well if one part of the couple makes more money than the other then you almost need to unless you plan on making every bill a hassle.  Let's say the girl makes 100k a year and the guy makes 30k.  Well when they decide to buy a nice home that could cost thousands of dollars in bills the guy is either really going to struggle or they are going to have to find a way to say "ok this month you pay this much and I pay this much". Or you could just combine your money and write one check. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
100% you will play as the girl all the time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely a keeper, but how did she work on it without you noticing it? ü§î
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks about 20 in the new trailer and she looked about 12 or 13 in the first game 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So do you go into stores and tell them you love jesus and how he's gon save you and sell people muffins and then give that money to your pastor who probably turns around and buys little girls so he can trade them for little boys?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're gerudo. They live in a sweltering desert and mostly only with other women. Off topic time of the month must be hell. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
of course it's a given. pretty girl in tank top and shorts, 500 upvotes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For once it is worth a like because she is skilled!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
dude i would pay your wife some good money if she ever made me one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The looks were item 2. The girl is item 1.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My grandma, like many grandmas, has to be able to run every toolbar known to man in her browser.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, he spent about half his net worth in one big surge. I think he wanted to save up another 30-40 billion to donate all at one.

Or Melinda decided to ease up and only make him donate a couple billion each time before she would put out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you have a girlfriend or are married?   If so, what does she think of your collection. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she bring it down to the basement for you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My money is on its his mom pretending to be Dylan cause she wants to buy him a game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Armenia was pretty lucky it was a Georgian woman, not an Azerbaijani woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you don't understand how litigation works.

It costs you money- a lot of it- to retain an attorney. Just the retainer is at very least $1,000. Then you are paying him or her several hundred dollars an hour for their time, or their paralegal about half that for theirs. Then there's filing fees, etc.

Say you want to go pro se. Be ready to spend hours reading up on what paperwork you need to file with whom and when. Filing fees still apply, budget for about $350 to file initial paperwork. Another hundred to two hundred to have the other party served.

Let us know how your lawsuit comes out. TLDR: Suing somebody doesn't mean "they were wrong so they send me free money while I sit here."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a girlfriend to spend money on I'm not a single 25 year old with too much disposable income.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl doesn't need to be any closer to food. All ~~she~~ it needs are a ton more chromosomes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  she did not receive any of the gold

topkek
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These girls wont even be friends in a couple years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She just bought about 6 months of you being oblivious to her fucking another dude
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea idk. I mean I don't want my wife to have less just because she makes less than me. We have kids, so it's a moot point now, but once they grow up I don't see why I would penalize her for making less money by saying "well I earned more". Idk, it just sounds like a roommate arrangement to me, rather than joint marital finances. I would feel like crap having tons of money and doing whatever I wanted while my wife barely had any spending money.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Their "example" was set almost a decade ago when they sued the owner of WoWScape for something like $80,000,000 and won. 

The owner ran away to Costa Rica with the $3,000,000 she made from WoWScape.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but then you spend all your gold on the girlfriend badge and some asshole hacker comes in and takes the badge and half your gold with him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe she's just a gold digger and found the right guy... you never know üòì
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless he/she earns 5$ a month he/she can get both
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend and I have about 200 hours in boi :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Something something I used to spend 10 hours hacking the game so she was shirtless /circlejerk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well those are 9 months she'll never get back....9 months closer to the grave.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D.Va is also 15 or something, so there's that

Edit: Misremembered the story, she was 16 when she was drafted, and is 19 now. Carry on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you have to be a very, very lucky man. with a very lucky girlfriend(s)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A friend of mine in college paid for her games by just going to party's and collecting everyone's beer caps. 

She basically got paid to party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well in the first game she turned out to be married. So...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ummmm she'll be fine but let her rest until she has a pulse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're spring loaded so she can fire them into the philtrums of her enemies
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you can get money for your daughter out of it great. If not what a waste of time for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This chick is gonna be SO busy when there's like 2,000,000 people playing the game. How will she keep up?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is a free... a free.. she is a free citizen of the world!

Not many, just one. ;)

She deserved it for telling her dream to gamers. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Table top gamers who are socially awkward and difficult to talk to?! Inconceivable! lol I jest, I have some friends who TT, 40k, Shadowrun, D&amp;D games. They're cool, so long as you don't have girls around. My friends are total nerds, but they're great guys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol it is perfectly fine, my friend! In fact, it even made my day! :D Thanks for making a sad girl happy! :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do it dude. She'll have the time of her old life
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So fucking accurate. I am totally one of the dudes asking where manriks wife is, I had no fucking idea where to find her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping she turned into a radioactive zombie or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so is she a gamer or does she just tolerate your gaming?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At first I didn't know if it was her or not, lol. She looks so different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like shooter games I always have since I was 7. I am a girl. This is some bull  honkey shut it IOS
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, I would like to see her try it on now...... This is exactly what it's like lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
assholes like sarkesian only care about the oversexzulaization of women. not men.

men are not equal....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pokeman? Harry Potter? I hope you get a girlfriend some day, fella, but I'm sure as hell not holding my breath. LOL!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
plus it doesn't look like she made a big deal out of it, she just got mad behind his back, so who cares. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; It's cool because women can be just as cool but we don't see that very much.

So, diversity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dump her now. Once a liar, always a liar.

:P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah fuck you for liking video games! How dare you insult the intelligence this niche audience by trying to insinuate that a *girl* plays video games. Gah, some people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love awkward zombie's humour she's great I especially loved her smash bro's ones lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she do anal? I only want to watch if she gets her asshole demolished.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still can't stop thinking that her name sounds like a Klingon insult.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I wanted my comeback I'd wipe it off her chin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cool but take her to a Vet aswell get her chipped and all that stuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's so much fun. I love pissing people off with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hate to break your bubble...Dickgirls and Futanari aren't the same..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
sad pathetic morons do u think she really gives a shit about a bunch of nerds fapping to her and pretending to give a shit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who say's I'm mad? In fact, you're the one starting to lob personal insults for some reason. I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings and made you aware that your imaginary internet girlfriend is a phony who has a fake online persona so that sad pathetic people like you think that she's an "OMG gamer girlz lol" but she doesn't give one iota of a shit about you or games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never hated her but she never wowed me in anything BUT alien, so maybe i'll try this 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude has no reflex. So I'm hoping she's gobbling down your knob and not neglecting the snowballs.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's really fucking cool, should have named her "A girl"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she the one who needs to bleach her asshole?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well if you think about it, she could enjoy herself again and again, less work for you ;) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gamer guys these days are so lucky.  In my day gamer girls were so rare.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have like 15ish videos and no one ever watches them. I still upload and record because it's fun in itself. I have a friend who does the same and no one really watches her stuff either. It's just for fun, it adds another layer to the entertainment we get from video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your going to turn her into a twitch gamer beggar
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bae'Va best waifu, but seriously. She's super fun to play and really hard to kill, hope they keep her like this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As someone who is going on year 9 with my girl, that was my first thought lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[This is his wife.]( His wife is likely a lovely woman, but she is not exactly a supermodel...I am an asshole.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, you're that guy.  Who cares?  My game says Aeris.  It's what I grew up on.  I'll stick with it.  If it's Aerith in the remake, then so be it, she'll go by Aerith.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha can you imagine the slew of people defending their online girlfriends though? That or "i only play for the acheivements bro"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Yeah, that's my wife.

fucking nice dude! Is she single?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hey I'm going to pretend to be mad in this video It'll be funny"

"oh no! People think i'm actually mad! I never thought that would happen!" 

What did you think she expected? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend gets mad that I don't have enough time for video games. She asked me to call out of work the other day to play Uncharted!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should go find a carpenter and tell him or her they garner no respect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True, but LAUREL'S BACK so it's all okay. Then again I'm biased, cause I may or may not share a name with her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a difference between dudes drawing dudes for hetro dudes to look at, and dudes drawing women for hetro dudes to look at. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, people are online for that... and the occasional girl or friend comes over to play on your other computer with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I boycott women in hopes that they'll *become* good men.

*I like men.*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even Bonnie stung a bit...I was nice to her even when she fucked us over and got the group captured. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would stick my dick so far up that asshole she won't shit right for a week. Uuuhhh yeeeeeeeaaahhhh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that feeling when your girlfriend's long distance so these sorta things can't happen :/  

but, yeah, she's a keeper it seems like. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol you're so funny! Yeah go jack off to gamer girls somewhere else kid it was an obvious typo but you try (to hard might I add) to be funny.

____________________ TOPIC 23 ______________________________

If you look closely she's wearing a skin suit, she's not actually that large
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the real reason why armor on women is skimpy as fuck. For the Cosplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she still just put her hair up. she is some hot asiany 20something with the same glasses that entirety of 20somethings wear and big tits and a blue tanktop.



- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FFXIV is pretty good about that.

Something that's skimpy on a female character is skimpy on men and something that covers the entire body covers everything on anyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it's refreshing to see a cosplay that isn't centered around "look what an attractice woman i am, and look how big my breasts are!".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not *her*, she doesn't even do good cosplays. Always so centered around boobs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Borderline? You can almost see her labia damit. This isn't even cosplay, it's foreplay. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, speaking from experience, half of the reason you make the costumes "Sexier" is actually that wearing a full cosplay outfit all day can be HELL, I usually do it for comfort, and she might aswell.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude you're stuck on boobs look at her hips and legs for fuck sake fuck you what the fuck is wrong with you, I don't like you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mei has way bigger tits than that. The rest of her looks right though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The women in Andromeda looks like an ugly flat chested downer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You guys are the reason Hollywood photoshops bigger breasts onto girls like Keira Knightley.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always spend way too much time customizing my characters and then end up covering it in armor after a few minutes.

Maybe I should create female characters, since their armor covers up barely anything in most MMORPG's nowadays...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, she probably doesnt have such big boobs, at least not as picture 1 suggest. I think it's her bra doing the work here. 
In other picture, especially the last one, you can see her "real" boobs size.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, yes, but in most places of work both men and women wear clothing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm really into synthetic female voices. Kind of like Traynor, but less British and with smaller boobs. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Please show me this cosplay porn because I'm inclined to think you're just talking about women cosplaying a character that wears revealing clothing in which I'd tell you that you dont know what cosplay porn is

No really, I'll wait.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then you might know why she looks the way she does.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would like to see her do a Saber cosplay as well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still use the pair on the right though, there's still life in her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's going on with the lighter-blue lump on her left boob? Underwear bulge or shitty photoshop?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why dont you upvkte that girl without armor?? She got boobs. You have to upvote everything with boobs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some women half even bigger, like the size of half-dollars, or even bigger.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's lovely to see a woman cosplay without feeling the need to alter the costume to get her tits out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if I have a thing for [women in medieval armor](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;The model here probably has legs that make up 45% of her height (which is average).


Model 51.65% leg

C'mon dude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I noticed that upon reading the title again, but was pretty confused for a bit. I wear size 3.5 and my husband wears 13.5. Never known a woman to wear size 9, or a husband and wife to wear the exact same size for that matter. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she is just really insecure about her body and thinks bigger boobs will make people like her, so she keeps getting bigger and bigger implants. But then her clothes don't fit so she stretches out other sizes. Don't be so inconsiderate. Geez. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, real women vary in size in the real world. They're not all super petite, five foot nothing teddy bears.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not a joke. She has a serious cosplay, she was not looking to be objectified. She's literally wearing full genderless armour, and yet is STILL treated like the armour is lingerie. That's not cool.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is Tracer (who has a giant machine over her chest) so loved by everyone?

If you're going to cover up a chest, give me Mei any day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and I always thought that Princess Peach wore a big long dress that covered everything except her feet...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
WHAT ? 

The armor covers all of her body like it should ?! 

The fck is this ? 

You going to tell me armor shouldnt be just a bikini top and some string tangas !?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whatever dude, still hot as fuck.

girls as thicc as oatmeal usually have big butts and big boobs and less belly fat tho because of their curves
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe he/she has just been loafing around here since the last time it was posted?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh, pretty average cosplay, she should have covered the tattoos. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love that someone with small tits finally cosplayed her. She looks off with huge honkers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude adding 20-30lbs to these 5'4 game girls puts them overweight. I didn't degrade any body type. Fat doesn't = bad, I never said that. But fat is fat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The costume is great, her face is great, but her body isn't athletic enough to be Samus
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For the guys and girls that have fursuits I think *every* suit is bespoke
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, boobs that big on a fat girl is still impressive. _BUT_ they're fake. So it's cheating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your momma is so dumb she wears a diphthong for underwear. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I can't. But I mean if she was overweight or something
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She got big boobies so I call her big boobies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I first saw the glove bit on the flattened image I thought it was the back and that the pink part was her butthole. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
do you get a lot of girls pming you their tits?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she the bit with one tit bigger than the other?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's still thick, you can tell by her arms and thighs. 

Note that fat =/= thick

Basically, if she posted nudes on reddit, it'd probably be on /r/thick 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does her head look so big proportional to her body
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a boob-haver, I appreciated this too (realistic boobs yay!) but they actually jump a bit then settle back into the same plane they were on before. Put your mouse under one of her boobs while she has clothes on, her boobs will settle and end up in the same place. So, not so realistic.

____________________ TOPIC 24 ______________________________

Looking like that she can call herself whatever she wants.

That's what I love about the video game girls, man...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
graduate school isn't a job?  you can study game design at other schools and I wasn't saying men were "better off" financially.  I was saying it's probably better to attend a program that is competitive and not one that is signing up women only to look progressive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There should be a Lv.99 girl in a golden bikini as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There were no men playing that, just boys and some girls. 

So it separated the boys from the boys.

Petch looks like she's got some coconut cream pies for us. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shit my first time drunk in high school I drank three Miller high lifes and that was all she wrote. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just me or is this what literally every girl at the gym looks like
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
12 year old girls look like that where you're from?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Her name? She goes to another school, you probably don't know her."

Joel should still be in his late 40s while ellie looks like she's in her late teens
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are a lot of jobs that have down time. My wife works really hard but there are days when she just doesn't have much to do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What sort of mileage do you get? I have an 85 Camaro (with the 305 v8), and she gets about 19 mpg, and I think that's pretty good. An Rx7 must get better than that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My typical day is work from 7 to 4, gym with wife from 5 to 630/7, cook dinner and hang out until she goes to bed then play games for an hour or two afterwards. 

That's just on gym days. Non gym days it's pretty much the same without the gym, we just hang out more. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah Violet Berlin, now that I am older than she is in this video, I actually find her quite cute. But where the fuck did Andy Crane's career go? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only way she can get a MAN these days.  ;-)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let me guess, she was either a high school student or an immature college student.

No sane, decent human being would do that preemptively. Man or Woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Um, she could of done that with JavaScript or Python. Have you taught her how to program? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean the historical age for women to start giving birth?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well all of my close friends are girls, so I don't (despite how nice they look).  But I'm also antisocial and ugly so maybe I'm am exception
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is the monkey a woman? i thought the monkey was male, why is it being spoken of as if it were not male?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This looks like a great way for older guys to meet teenage girls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah, it's all staged, the girl pretends to see the ghoul the first time in her life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok be honest. If you got *that good* at a game, do you really think you'd have time to meet girls?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure no one called her ugly in middle school. I know I wanted believe in the code.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why did we get downvoted? If this is because people think I'm a horny teenage boy, I'm really not. I'm a 16 year old girl, and I like her makeup. It's done well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this guy only fuck girls between 1 and 12 y o?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you see her without makeup for the first time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a woman and no, I am not that smart! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a nice life you've got there. I take it you have a job and a girlfriend?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a nice setup for her age. 10yr old me would have loved to have hardware that could play 30fps. Back in the 90s I'd often end up playing games at what was probably 10-15fps.

&gt; Megan Golden

Ah, so she's a country singer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got late to a test today because I was masturbating to her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So if she was 12 you'd be all for it?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You've never been on Minecraft haven't you?

Girl: Can I have some diamonds?
Boy: Take mine
Boy: Take mine to
Boy: me three
Boy: want to be my girlfriend I'm 9
Boy: I have butter
Boy: kill the squids!
Boy Here's some
Boy: I got you.
Boy: This naked mod is so hot the blocks are so real
Boy: Say 123 if you want a girlfriend
Boy: Here you go

1054 points. Title: "the best female character of 2016." It's a motherfucking hand holding a motherfucking walkie-talkie.

Are you shitting me, people?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like I don't want to be "that girl" but it's Ar*k*ane ._. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's no way.  If she's 12 then I'm a pedophile.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is extremely predictable on her middle east policy. Chaos and destruction.
You want more of that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a fact that she has gotten younger since middle school. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Normal stuff but it was a lot older. Vintage shit with all the girls hairy all over 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do you mean? 

How does working in an office of primarily women, make women more naturally prone to being insecure? 

Surely it would have been learned at a younger age than most people working in an office? 

And if it's not learned (Which I'm pretty sure it is) then it would have been assigned at birth anyway so I'm struggling to see what the office has to do with it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not about boy vs girl. It's older sibling vs younger.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ask him if he is a boy or a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ironically, no women are employed here or no women were pictured. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't she have a British accent? The old one actually looks British.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always see this gif and give points to the driver. I don't know if I would have thought fast enough to embarrass her like that. I'm sure the best I could do would be honking the horn. Congrats to this driver for their quick thinking and smart maneuvers.

Bioshock 1


Tried to drain the girls on my 2nd playthrough


Drained the first girl, watched what happened. (The first one you meet in the pipe)

Couldn't do it again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The horror man, bail before you have kids! Next thing you know she'll want you to help change diapers, and watch the little troglodytes for girls night out!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She said to stop by and visit before she left and I went and she was already gone. What a bitch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My niece was born in 03 and she loved my NES until it stopped working a few weeks ago. So yeah I don't see how people would think that out of the ralm of possibilities 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 4 and it was Christmas morning.  We were through all of the presents as far as my mom knew.  Can't fool me.  I saw it sitting there tucked in the corner behind the tree.

I kept asking for the last present and she kept telling me there are no more.  I finally crawled behind the tree and grabbed it.

My mom couldn't figure out what it was.  I later found out my dad bought it without her knowing.  

As I tore back the paper I was extremely excited.  NES with Mario Brothers.  That Christmas morning started a hobby I still have 30 years later.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I was dating someone and they went through even a 10th of as much effort as she's gone through for him I'd be excited and have that happy vomity feeling you get when you think someone actually cares for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you live in rural areas the girl brings her new boyfriend home who is actually her cousin. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was worse but not more succesfull. I realized that habbo was full of suckers actually trying to get girls online, or atleast they liked the idea of it. So I played a girl and started charming these guys, making them wanna move in with me, in my room ofc I'll need ur furniture im the woman in the house! After a couple of times I felt like a complete whore and just... stopped.

Habbo had some really fun shit tho, kickwars, RP, banter..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Terraria, although I couldn't get my girlfriend to play it. It's worth a look
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you kill her? Because if she pulled that shit I wouldn't let her stay there for for very long
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend thought for sure that was a joke and that me and her dad were in on it, till months later I brought it up again that I really do see gold.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the Ewoks. The woman went from a little startled to "Fuck this shit."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your family should want you to be happy, not suffocated. You have to live your life for *you* not for them, not for your cousin, not for your girlfriend. For *you* and all those awesome characters *you* are in video games! Be happy man! Don't settle for anything less!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My parents sat me and my girlfriend down when we last visited them and told us my brother was bitten by an alligator. My dad followed up by saying that the alligator had AIDS when they found it so now my brother has Gator-AIDS. My parents were so proud of that joke.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kids are only young once, I miss having my gaming time some days but I'll only be able to play with my little girl at 3 years old for so long before she's 4, then 5, etc.

Eventually she'll be old enough that I can pass the torch and see if she wants to start playing WITH her old man - but for now I'll keep my playtime to after she is in bed or napping.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was in college I bought an n64 from a local pawn shop just to play drunk Mario Kart 64. I'm a female who lived with 3 other girls, they gave me shit until they got drunk and played it. It was the center piece of our living room. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
hey we spent ALOT of time together but she takes 2 naps a day so it got pretty boring 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah what's that about? I really miss split screening with friends. Even my girlfriend wanted to play with me but couldn't. So dumb.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vivian for mine. Vivie for short. Something about the way she looks kept bringing a Viv type sound to mind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
probably Tetris on the Game Boy. (original)

after that it would be counterstrike pre 1.6, it was like, even before school an hour sometimes, then immediately after school till sleep and even on the weekends. i did stuff like "play 24h on our server"- events or whatever that was. don't know how many hundreds of hours, of maybe thousands.

then i became aware of beer and girls.

nowadays its rocketleague. i have about 460h since last summer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I let my 5 year old niece play BK a few weeks ago. Between the clams, mines, and snacker (which made her freak out and start screaming) she had me finish Treasure Trove Cove for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty much the same here. I've been with my gf for a while and when we get married there will be no surprises as to what the other likes to do for fun or what they dont want to do. 

My gf enjoys watching me play games and I enjoy helping her bake cookies (which ... I reap rewards for, admittedly)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love seeing stuff like this, look how happy she is to be making something she things her dad/family enjoys!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's mostly my dad, my mom is actually pretty darn cool about things. Only reason I got my stuff back after only a couple of days is because she fought on my side the whole way. Unfortunately things aren't so equal in my house so if he decides to take them away again she can't do much for me. I do want to look into leaving, but I need to be in a better position to do so. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not everyone lives with their SO. Or maybe she got home early?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol I would only watch G4 if there was the sexiest women around the world TV show at night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I shit you not, Todd Howard looks just like my girlfriend's mom.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Got it from "Santa" for Christmas about the time Donkey Kong 64 came out, so I got the Jungle Green console that came packaged with DK64. Me and my younger brother would often go to our playroom and find Dad playing DK64 by himself. When we got old enough to stop believing in Santa we figured that Dad (who wasn't a gamer himself) just bought the N64 because he wanted to play Donkey Kong.

Other memories: 

-Borrowing my cousin's copy of Goldeneye and never returning it (in my defense, he never asked for it back).

-Beating my brother at just about every multiplayer game we ever played, and sometimes letting him win because I'm a nice older brother like that.

-Getting really scared by Queen Gohma in Zelda: OoT because I'm really arachnophobic. So even though she was the first boss I was stuck on her for months. I kind of miss Zelda games being scary, actually.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I try to stay away from sorority girls - especially trideltas
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I met her last month, and I'll be seeing her again this weekend! She's an absolute sweetheart
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My 7 year old sister still describes it as the "unicorn worm." she's excited to catch them every time they pop up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Our local Hooters a few months back had Heros of the Storm on. I was the only one among my friends who new what it was.

I need new friends...

At least my wife was close, she asked me if it was LoL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Does she start showing up more often later on?

Sadly no, i'd say that she starts showing up even less.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a similar experience, GF wasn't great with the two thumbsticks. I think the key is that if you play strategically, there are very few "quick" moments in the game. She got better at the sticks because she enjoyed this game so much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember last time this was posted there was a story about a guy that tried to do this but his wife to be was shitty at games. So she tried for about 20 min before eventually giving up on beating the game. Which sparked a huge fight that ended up being the genesis of their breakup. Super sad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she was pretty terrible at her first couple E3 presentations.  she's gotten better though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A long time ago,  some friends of mine's little boy lost his tooth before bedtime and was absolutely heart broken.   My friend called my mom,  whom the kids had never met,  and she pretended to be the tooth fairy.   She told him not to worry about it,  as she was really good at finding teeth.   After he went to sleep,  they snuck a dollar under his pillow with a note that said "found it!". She ended up calling him whenever he lost a tooth after that.   When he finally met her,  he recognized her voice and was amazed that my mom was the tooth fairy.   Or at least he played it off pretty good.   No idea when he stopped believing it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom admitted a few years ago that she "stopped learning years ago". I couldn't believe it. I asked her to repeat herself. She did. It was terrible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This reminds me of a friend of mine. Her boyfriend told her that he would use his tax return to either buy a new TV or buy her an engagement ring. She was excited and assumed he told her this to say without saying he was getting her an engagement ring. She came home the next day to see that he had bought a new TV. She broke up with him soon after. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure no one will believe me, but she looks really similar to my ex
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I vaguely remember her past, but don't remember a drinking problem o.O
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Omg you two are the best big siblings ever. I remember playing on my older brother's SNES with him and my dad when I was younger, I ended up being the lone gamer.

She is a lucky lucky girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've always felt that if my mom had me a little younger, she would have been a great gaming partner. We played left for dead together a couple of times and it was a hilarious fun time because we both sucked at it, but she's always super interested in what I'm playing. Unfortunately I play via a PC hooked to a 65" TV in a small room with just enough space for a recliner, so having two people in there just didn't work comfortably in the long term.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom was always sick when I was young so my grandma lived with us. My grandma made sure I knew how much she hated me everyday. I couldn't stand being home so I spent all my time at the arcades instead of hanging out with hoodlums. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right! that letter was fully-loaded... anyways I learned some new moves you could try on your new girlfriend if you think you can handle em'
hold X+O then -&gt; ^ &lt;- &lt;- ^ -&gt; or for a finishing move go forward/back really fast 13 times.
cya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do that too, my girlfriend kept wondering why we were at about the same time but I had 10+ more hours than her... because I was playing, paused to go do something, and came back a couple hours later to continue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude I know went to a dinner with his lady at another couples place, after dinner the couple put on twitchTV for entertainment. They weren't entertained. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me neither. When I first heard her singing I fell in love, but when the end of the game hit I knew I had to do this.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was the one where Lily is mad that Ted brought a random hoe to her birthday party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Diablo. If she likes it you won't get away from the computers anymore!

____________________ TOPIC 26 ______________________________

Who needs a wife or girlfriend when you have all that vr porn? Obby
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Along with the fact that she's not attracted to you sexually
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; no one is bangin that broad.

What? Girls like sex too you know. Just because she is unattainable for you doesn't mean she doesn't have sex lmao.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is me asking why men aren't sexualized in the same way as women somehow shaming you? I don't think you know what the buzzwords you're clumsily repeating actually mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I identify as a female, will I be allowed to join? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got it specifically for co-op with my girl and she's basically obsessed with the game at this point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is your girlfriend sing-...I wanna have sex with your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is a minor now. You thought about having sex with her. It doesn't matter if you say "when she is 18". You sexualized her because you thought about having sex with her. I will not further argue with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she enjoyed the Lego Harry Potter games, why not try other Lego games?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a euphemism, it's not gender biased. But congratulations on being female. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You probably won't make it to the top because you aren't an attractive woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right. Keep watching porn while I fuck your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We all know it was some sort of fighting type move, since she is obviously a normal type. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are more picky than me my good man.  That is a definite would as is.  Of course I had thing for her for decades.  I am a sucker for redheads.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doing that is the non-lethal route, you can also just straight up kill her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No no. I like porn. I didn't like what this guy liked though (vintage, hairy women)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;You do realize that giving people HRT actually makes them get the sexual desires of the opposite sex, right?

actually trans HRT rarely makes a MTF person attracted to guys, or a FTM person attracted to girls

&gt;I must have missed that one

[here] (
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like me and her might still have sex
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
transgender is male and/or female.

better? Or should it be;

transgender is male and/or/nor female.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SSSNIPERWOLF.  It use to be SexySexySniperwolf,  she was a straight up slut there,  but that was before she found that slave that would do anything for her and she made a new channel.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This type of shit gets frontpaged and you guys still act like sexualization of women in video games doesn't happen. smfh.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thing is this was true before online gaming was a thing.  In my experience it really just tends not to appeal to women... most guys I find are interested and want to try, most women I show games to just say "I don't get it can we do something else?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Old Video, maybe she flipped her views to appeal to the Youth Vote 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"cis" women

You mean normal women or actual women? Most people just call them women because that's what they are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then there's the guy she's not telling you about aka Titanfall 2. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Toys for Bob were really pandering to the female audience there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"look at my profile for more content" 

*goes to her profile*

Well, it IS definitely some kind of content
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually I think the majority of people don't care if their avatar is male or female, in most games your avatar's gender has no effect gameplay, so choosing not to play it simply because there is no female avatar is really quite shallow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just drop the trans adjective, and you have your answer. So a trans woman is a woman, and a trans man is a man. But Scarlett is a trans woman, and so the earlier poster was incorrect to call her a dude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a survey the other day that asked for gender. Male, female, transgender or other....WTF is other....pony?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then it shows her looking surprised when she falls, she obviously thought she could lean there because of her gender, I love how you avoid obvious things like that, great fun
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and sex... but that can be sorted by wonder woman 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Male or female. They are different people, not just a gender swap
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You realize the person you just responded to is her right haha?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually think that's a girl... not that it matters, amirite? /highfive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shannon's first experience in Virtual Reality.  She was really brave considering she hates horror games. Putting on the Oculus is like being right there in those halls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
its quite obvious she thinks its because of her gender, girls are always like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost as if men and women are attracted to different features in each other.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are not "assigned" a gender, you are identified as being either male or female. You either accept the body were born with or you don't. You can either accept a fundamental fact of life, or you can be delusional and try to twist all matters of facts and reality to fit that delusion. You can either be indifferent to or embrace what you are, or can cry and be miserable about what you are not.  You either have gender dysphoria or you don't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I stopped being attracted to video games and started talking to real women. Because you know, you can actually do things with them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
my only beef here is that you can't say women in general want ANY job. there is no general job that most women want. just like dudes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Online multiplayer...  Is going to be men pretending they are women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those are just cyclists that have sex with both men and women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Idk man bring a normal girl there and see how that goes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;she

&gt;C U R R E N T Y E A R and still using gendered pronouns?

Shes not having sex with anyone, for one. And way to insult females because you are a butthurt 30 year old virgin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of females to choose from in the last 4 Call of Duty games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They exist IRL too. But the shells are tiny. 

One is even marketed as a 'woman's CCW'.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if the student doesn't identify as male or female? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just still your gender but gay, you'd probably put your sperm into a woman.

Hogtie a woman, put her on the train tracks, and let a train hit her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course she survived it. You're playing on super easy mode.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't ever get tired of carrying my shit. She always dies in the first dungeon after I get her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That might be why. I don't think I talked to him after I talked to the hanged lady. This will make things much easier. Thanks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bill Murray: "Do you ever have deja vu?"

Old lady: "I'm not sure but I can check the kitchen."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh THAT'S what she's saying! I always thought it was "La bee da boy da bahhhh, da da la da de da...." 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My fianc√© hated playing FPS because she couldn't use the twin sticks. I had her try Portal since she could just take her time with it and she loves solving puzzles. Needless to say, she was having a blast and started to get the hang of the controls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I glanced upon the jeans she had put on that day, and found myself addicted, and unable to stop staring.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's 11mo so I'm sure she could handle a rogue or hunter at this point
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I miss mama jokes.

Yo mama so fat her blood type is Ragu
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Back when I was a little girl in France,

I used to pick pretty daisies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Getting a girl friend is easier then setting that thing up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she smokes weed out of an apple.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's one of my favorites. I don't know why it screwed her's up so much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yo mama is not yo mama because yo not her son and she not yo mama. Fixed it for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Never really said she would be scared for life
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's look at it:

I figure it'll take her a few years to figure out the data clear button combo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not like playing her is crazy difficult or anything, so there's his first mistake
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl has got quite a thirst for that monster's D.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depends on *why* she feels sick....What if it's just too big to deepthroat? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She didn't learn how to do that on her own. Beware of a side man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think that's how you pick up girls &gt;.&gt;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Their water dragoon was a mermaid, I always wanted to know how they found her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Megaman is challenging if your a preteen girl. Battletoads is for real men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A female dog, i1m pretty sure, is spelt as Chienne.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Trying to get the wife to look into playing this with me.  Co-op looks to be a lot of fun.  Though this might be a bit too fast paced for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was that one guys girlfriend that liked portal, maybe you should show her portal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depends on what kind of games she likes. If she's not a hardcore gamer, or is just interested in visuals and story I'd recommend some of the Telltale games. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll teach her the many combinations of 1 and 0.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try playing Conker's Bad Fur day. I watch my girlfriend play and it stresses ME out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just looked it up.  It is.  It's cheap.  It's amazing.  My wife doesn't like video games, but she played this (before giving up when the difficulty cranked up).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'd think it's a generational thing, but I saw some woman in her 60s do the same thing yesterday.  Damn near wanted to run her down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you have taught her nothing else... you have taught her patience.  Patientia est virtus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should totally do this! Go camping and teach him/her primitive fire and trapmaking techniques!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's setting her up so he can tickle his pickle
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was pretty much a female Hunter Thompson, plus people are being all pissy like they knew her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you stop looking at all the girlfriend simulators a so often they should at least show up less often in your queue
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*BMMMMM* **BMMMMM!!** Call yo mama in the room and show her how great you are!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of reasons one might do that. The main one is "Lydia got stuck somewhere and/or I can't locate her." Fast travelling can sometimes unstick her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just sneak in food and drink in your girlfriend's/wife's/own purse.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She will take half of your sweet rolls when she gets bored with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Oh, I needed to JUMP and throw her. My bad."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really wanted to see a train run over the hogtied woman in 4k.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't know she had the GI Joe, Kung Fu grip
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
actually me and my GF are enjoying Unravel currently, she plays while i watch and when she gets stuck we figure out what we need to do next. its a cute little puzzle game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend's name is Amber.

I too, am fond of Amberlamps...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would give her tongue as Yoshi. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does her game even run?

Sims 2 had some nasty memory issues and that's almost 14gb of stuff the game would have to constantly keep track of.

____________________ TOPIC 28 ______________________________

The sidekick idea came with the problem of having to share character development time between all of your comrades. If there was a partner you never used (and it was Flurrie) then you never heard him/her talk, meaning you didn't get to know that one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks exactly like I would expect a female redditor to look. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Idk, she's been getting a steady 3-4k on each video she's made since then. I'm sure she's content with that.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope. The game is linked to her account. You would have to game share her account to keep it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Plenty of places would take issue with an employee looking at pictures of women in bikinis.

Why? What if the person works at Sports Illustrated?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not sure if gifting her some early access indie shit is a good deed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he/she was mentioning that you listed "Xbox One S" as one of your top picks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Um just get steam. The game is cheap and unless you pirate it which you shouldn't do she can't play. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Religion already has. For example, [here's a quote]( about her from the bible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And when she does a chargeback you will also have your account(s) banned.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Credit where it's due - It's Ilona Bugaeva, [check out her instagram.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm just the artist, the material prices and stuff is handled by my older sis X3 you can contact her with the info on the site, sorry!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well considering skyward sword is the first in the timeline of current games released that link got the girl and the rest after didn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shouldn't he/she use the time on the game not the time of the real world?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If they are for personal use, then it isn't an issue.  Your title suggested your girlfriend's business is going to be producing and selling the stickers in the image.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had to check because I wasn't sure, no, her name is Kristen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she paid with credit/debt contact them and put a hold on the funds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Fate State Nite Ying-Yang knives SET"



Can you slap the owner? With the back of the hand, please. Make him/her go back to childhood and think why not just check the name on the internet...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Both Outrider and Battery are female specialists, and they are available at level 1.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The artist was probably trying  to figure out it it's a boy or girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And she's done nude modeling, since so many of the guys that follow her online can't figure that out. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no, but then again i was too busy fooling around with the neighbor girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she put it on a credit card do a charge back.  Fuck best buy for this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't get me Started, had a girl that would check out other guys all the time then go crazy if I even looked in the direction of another woman 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is a really beautiful piece of art :) Tell her that I said that :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not that she has more than most people, she just has never ever deleted any. If I did the same, my account would look something like that as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Video games don't cause violence, lag does.

But seriously, they don't. Maybe you could write about how video games influence people who would already be violent anyways. For example, there was one case where some girls imitated slender man and tried to murder another girl. Other than that, it's a research paper, so do some research.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This so much, though she always calls it "Intendo."

But we did have an Intellivision, so credit where due.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Delusional sexism? Sheesh.

26% of the consumer market is a small subset in that there is a huge book market outside of romance. The point is that if you are a guy, there is plenty of reading material for you out there. If you're a girl, there is plenty of reading material for you, too. The same can't be said about video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the idea is just that he can't legally say which company he works for. It's prior to the big Tyler changeover so he's still trying to protect his ass in some small way. So he can explain how it works but stops short of naming names so the woman can't go immidiatly to the press or authorities with the information she just received.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah she laughing all the way to the bank with your remark. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was bill gates. He probably accessed her online data in order to get everything so spot on. Coukdnt be coincidence.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I deleted Trivia Crack when it was the only game my wife was playing on her phone, and then we started seeing charges on our phone bill for random things we didn't want. Their use of ads which automatically signed you up for things was underhanded and unacceptable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Text her email and tell her to save that email address and you will be texted when she emails you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how her tech rig has a can of soda in it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She does if you talk to her and tell her you did it, but she doesn't recognize you or anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"we have no plans yet but that's a good idea!" 

.... That can't be his/her first time hearing that or even the though passing through their head. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was wondering if I just launched steam on her laptop in offline mode and mine in online mode since I would most likely require the online portions.  Does that work?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just out of interest, could you provide some examples of inaccurate claims she's made?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that is his plan.. I'm no law wiz but wouldn't suing someone over property rights get her/him far more money than selling copies would?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do I have to spell it out for you?  Maybe she was "seeing" the guy already before she told you... and that might have been related to the "fungal" infection...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a link to where you can view and buy prints of her stuff:

Really good work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some banks *never* delete information. When I was opening my bank account at my current bank, I had my family have access in case I died.  I glanced over when they were added me to my mother's accessible account and noted that they had my ten year deceased uncle under her list of accounts she can access, in red text. I commented on it an the woman opening my account said that I "wasn't suppose to see that", and that they keep the accounts reserved, but inactive.

I'm assuming in the case that there is some kind of legal trouble.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My main issue is that it isn't available for windows phone. But my girlfriend has an Iphone that I commandeer, so I guess it's okay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Anyone know what kind of materials she used to make this?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No she doesn't. You have to put it down in order for her to cuddle it which means you already stopped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There have been a few websites listed, but I feel none of these are fixing the problem: she downloads bloatware, spyware, etc. What you should do is make two users. Make one of them your name and make it the administrator and give it a password. Make the other one her name and don't give her user download privileges. Make sure you also make sure she only uses one web browser (delete the others) and download addblock plus. This way she wont see all these adds in the sidebar as she plays and she won't click them. If she wants to download something, have her tell you and you make sure it is safe. If it isn't tell her, if it is, download it for her next time you are over there on your admin user.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So why did you make her go outside to pick up your amazon order when you were already outside next to it? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my coffee, I don't like coffee. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I pressed her A and immoderately got a restraining order

____________________ TOPIC 29 ______________________________

To this day, I still haven't seen that video from Shia. It's sort of like how I haven't seen 2 girls 1 cup. By the time I hear about it, everyone's already done talking about it, so I know what it's about already.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
hot damn diggity, was I surprised when she keeled over and croaked
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Had no idea what it was until I saw what she said. Damn I'm slow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I forget to text back girls/know their existence when I'm gaming lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mentioned fucking Emma Watson, my head just FILLED with possibilities, damn you. Why did you have to say her name when it could have been anyone!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she was so embarrassed why is she telling anybody about it online?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I installed the game for my wife, and she's never played it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haven't seen it yet, but I see two girls and a unicorn. Should I be scared?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
damn this game looks awesome. I screamed like a little girl...a really..manly...little girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why would she need to work out if she is God to earthlings. If you were Superman, what point of working out would there be? Might actually be funnier if you were slenderish but strong as god.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean you didn't follow her into the mirror? You monster. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those girls look like the least coordinated people I have ever seen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to imagine that you playing a video game is the same to her as watching a superlong movie with lots of bloopers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Holy crap, how is this girl doing this? Seriously I need to know!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this game a sausage fest or something?  

Haven't seen one female character, at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You forgot that the woman goes on a homicidal rampage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was, but Mean Girls made her a star. That Herbie movie wasn't all that good. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Heads up: you might not want to google that name in the gif. Without the PSN prefix that's an anal prolapse porn actress. (and she is very good.)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is my biggest hang up with this whole thing. If it was just her, sure, remove it. But every damned character has the same god damned pose! Fuck off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lmao i thought that dude(second to the right) looked like a woman too but yeah its just clean looking guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They look awesome! Tell her to keep up the good work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn she just got roasted.  She is probably already regretting it and she has had for like a day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you don't know what a guy looks like either because you thought a girl looked like a guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I guess she does kind of have a look of, "oh. When did that get there?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what sucks is the camera angle. There was a god damned Chinook helicopter under her... I wanna see that mess getting made.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a fan of Amie's for so long it sucks to see everyone thinking she is actually mad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because you know when doesn't mean you know where.

You find her in 1892.  You search New York.  

Sucks to be you, she is actually in China.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh god, what the fuck does she do in hail?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jenny? Wasn't her name Claer? Or is this some reference I don't get? I haven't played the game much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just remember, if you aren't charming enough to flirt with women, just take drugs!

Remember, folks: 

If you could've used 'him' or 'her', you should be using 'whom'.

Valykries are female right?  Maybe it's Loki or another god spying on Kratos and his kid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagine she's watching a feed of all the webcams installed in the easels.

These people are going to forget how to even talk to women and start groping them. Jeez.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love that strip so much because i have a friend who is a huge superman fan. When i showed it to her she said alfred was cheating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's really great at knitting actually. she makes awesome apple pie and sucks a mean dick.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
oh, this one is so old, and I'm not talking about the girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh come on now. We all know she doesn't play video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a pixar movie of a little girl who thinks everyone loves her in *that* way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My offsprings could cartwheel out of her oven maker with those hips. Lordy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goddamn it, now i'm always going to think that when I see her name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If kratos is a woman here whose ashes are those?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's just the Aiming she ain't very good at it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is also like trying to mess around with my girlfriend when she's pissed off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never played the older games, but now that I think about it the Angelina Jolie movie had her living in a manor with a butler.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but "I don't really speak russian, but my friend did, so she talked to them." one of em was a girl...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, i guess i could play a game with your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh Damn I saw her on epiccon, she really pulled this off
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Defiently looks more like the actress who plays her now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey, hey, she's had a long time to mature, ok?

Don't show her mods or she'll never actually play the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The story is very deep. There are a lot of "talky bits" for her to take over and her decisions there will have a great impact on how the story plays out.

As one of the tool tips puts it, your decisions will decide the fates of characters and sometimes entire communities.

I just finished the MQ of the second expansion and I'm at 150 hours into game. I still have 10-15 side quests to finish and there is a NG+ mode which is good for going through and exploring different branches of the story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One thing I will give to Fallout 4 is that you do have three and a half main factions you can side with rather than just the option to kill yourself and/or everyone in Fallout 3- that is later retconned. 

It's also nice to be able to go full-on with one faction or another. I just got to the part where I met the railroad, saved, and proceeded to murder the shit out out Desmonda and the rest of her crew. None of those main characters were essential so I could just murder the other faction and be on my way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm 51 and I play sometimes, to a few selected games. Currently I'm finishing Fallout  4 for the 5th time (as a woman, this time. My wife was a bit jelous of Piper and Cait and Curie.. ..)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every bad game has good people behind it. Throwing bile at devs is rarely justified. It sucks to see people like that one Dragon Age 2 writer get a ton of hate just because she said the wrong thing at the wrong time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fallout 4 looked pretty indeed, but the woman and dogmeat should have been on the front.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is a lot of different approaches to the game, each with different outcomes. You can basically ruin your own story by making the wrong choices, for example; you can save that man's wife and thus her husband. This is just the top of the iceberg as you can totally fuck up the main story as well. That being said, it feels amazing to have to carefully think about your decisions as you will develop such sympathy with the characters in this game, that you will actually hate yourself for having bad outcomes

What I actually hope for is Ciri showing up in Cyberpunk 2077 as a minor cameo. She did say that [she's traveled to a world where people had metal in them and fought remotely with devices like a megascope](/spoiler)

Any of the Lego series. I play these games with my girlfriend all the time. Kind of a grind sometimes, but the LotR ones are pretty spectacular.

Or that the npc sees a mob way off the path and goes to engage it. Then once combat ends, the npc stands still while the game figures out the best path to get back to where the npc left the pre-determined path. Even if he/she ran ahead to engage mobs, they always run back to where they left the path!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
On the other hand in games like DayZ there is nothing less immersive than having a radnom encounter with someone sounding like a twelve year old girl.

My nydus worm has spewed so many banelings into her base.

CD Projekt Red is the best developer out there, when taking everything under consideration. There is no one over or beside them. There is only them. No contest.

Kudos and thank you for an unforgettable journey with the Witcher series. You guys and girls are awesome!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bioshock's the only one that actually had that in a dlc, it was one of Infinite's dlcs where you play as Elizabeth, everything but her was in black and white at times.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I said to myself, "Is there a new dlc that lets you play more as Batgirl?!"  Then I felt sad again.  Like normal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would be against it. Why not make a new game,a spin-off or even a completely new game, with a female protagonist? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think you're missing the most important part about this entire debacle though, and that is that the game allowed you to have a mammoth creature take a shit on women and children for the enjoyment of the player. That game was a solid 10/10. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It really wasn't much of a game, but it was a very solid interactive story.  I loved that I had the kind of control I had over her actions, and I felt like it was one of the few games I've played where my decisions really mattered.  When she experienced heartache, I felt that with her.  When she was happy or excited, I felt that too.  It was a rewarding experience, to be sure, but not one I had any interest in repeating.  I didn't get the perfect ending, I didn't *save* everyone, and that kind of sucked.  I would have liked to fully complete the game, but once I had beaten it, I didn't feel like it was an experience I'd want to repeat.  Subsequent play-throughs would have, I think, cheapened the experience.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she wants revenge for the girraffee's that are klled
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Lord of the Rings Online.

It's got nice graphics, neither too bad nor too good. Servers like Landroval and Laurelin allow role-playing, and you can find lots of RPers there. (Especially in the Prancing Pony) If she likes LotR, she'll like this too. 

There are also cosmetic items so that you can customize your character even more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, her like full character model.  She's sorta one of the major players for the story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While my wife grumbles along playing Witcher 3 as only a male character. She loves the game, just wishes she could pick a female. 

Is there a mod for that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish you had made it "a man searching for his son", while this could still work for girls who play FO4, lets be honest the majority of players are probably male
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; One of the staples of an rpg is that you have choice. Fallout 4 steamlined everything to the point where you dont really have much choice. 

Yes we all know this by now, no need to keep regurgitating it. Its STILL an RPG. Just because certain rpg aspects arent as good as they could be doesnt mean its just not an rpg at all. Thats absolutely retarded. 

The fact of the matter is that rpg stands for roleplaying game. In Fallout 4 you create your own character, you CHOOSE what he/she/it looks like, you CHOOSE what they wear, you CHOOSE which abilities to upgrade. To say that it isnt an rpg at all because it doesnt have as many speech options as FO3/NV is just retarded. 

Tl;dr: just because it isnt a perfect RPG doesnt mean it isnt an RPG at all.

Songbird =(

I really felt bad. It did seem to love her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he is immersed in another reality.. How much does he actually like her..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think both gameplay and characters can evolve a little each game. Character much more so than gameplay, cause there's only so many stories one character has in him/her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it did, it was a very rudimentary version. Crysis 1 is also not the pretty girl she once was without mods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My GF loved watching me play life is strange and the horror one (can't remember the name).

Pretty much any decision based game as she could enjoy the story and help make decisions - like why she decided to go out with such a nerd in the first place. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a bonus, use "setessential a2c94 1" to make her never die (she goes into a downed state until combat ends).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Peggle. My girlfriend isn't a gamer and she loves it. Its "cutesy" and has adorable characters, plus simple gameplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't play Witcher 3 or FFVII so I didn't experienced this on my own.

There should be more games with choices that have an impact on the story/characters.

I think Mass Effect made that pretty good with the choices you made in the Suicide Mission. I don't think we need a way to bring back Characters that would just devalue the character and the bond you made over time with him/her.

The players actions and choices should lead to either saving the character or letting him/her die not provide a cheap way out by bringing the character back to life. Most games nowadays are more linear in they story telling. We have Great open worlds which can be explored but still have such a linear approach.

There was a female lead in a popular video game series? The first one was released back in 1986?

B...but Women were supposed to be underrepresented in video games!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More like she likes Persona 4 than the entire series in general. I could be wrong but I don't see any of the others in there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well you have a backstory in FO4. 

Didn't try the game as a woman (bore me to death already with one character so..) but as a man, you're supposed to be a veteran. You also should have done a speech at the local school so maybe an important veteran.

And then you go into the wasteland and get shittalked by stupid BoS. Fuck off Bethesda.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Compared to sayyy the AI standard in modern video games to the likes of claptrap. I enjoyed the system and it was fluid and pretty bug free. I liked using it and being able to chose my style of play using the different options being presented with. 

But idk maybe you're right and the DLC just made me more biased towards her character and my love for her. She's perfect üòç
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fully agree.  Witcher is so overrated.  Yah it is a good looking game, but the combat sucks, the magic powers are pretty much useless, all the monsters are roughly the exact same, all the weapons are basically the same, the armor looks like the puffy pirate shirt from Seinfeld, it is a game that I just do not understand the hype.  I could not get into the lore and felt like every mission was ok kill this monster and comeback and get a reward, or save this chick and then fuck her, and then go save another chick, fuck her and save the world.  Also there were way too many useless items, and my inventory is like 99% stuff I would never use.  I could go on forever about how average this game is and will probably get downvoted for it.  When playing the witcher the only thing I could think was, damn this is not as good as skyrim, I should go back and play that.  I basically beat the game, and then deleted it off my ps4, and will never play it again.

They're all worth playing. I think 1 is the best, and 2 is the worst. My wife adores 3 and it's one of her favorite games. They're a good time, for sure.

Chrono trigger!!!!! My favorite rpg as a young girl. Well second favorite FF6 forever!

People on reddit complain about everything. If someone gave them $100 million they'd complain about the taxes and having to drive across town to pick it up. And really it'd be a lot more convenient if they just direct deposited the money instead of giving them a check...

The story was decent, it wasn't like groundbreaking storytelling/writing, but Fallout has never been about that (at least not in many years). In fact Bethesda has never been about that. They're good at one thing - creating a really visually appealing and immersive world that you get to explore and enjoy. If you like open world sandboxes with incredible details, interesting buildings/areas to explore, and easter eggs everywhere, then you'll enjoy Fallout 4.

If you don't care about that stuff but want really good plotlines and writing, or really good combat, then Fallout is not and never has been for you. The combat and writing is not atrocious, it's just not great.

I will say that one thing this game has that the previous versions have never had is the playable character's dialogue, which is staggeringly expansive. They must have spent a year alone on each character (one male, one female) talking to every random little character throughout the entire world. It's crazy. In previous games you just select what your character says, but your character doesn't actually speak the lines in-game, only the NPCs speak at all.

The graphics are fine, I don't know how anybody can complain. Especially when the modding community for these games is and has always been so ridiculous. There's already a bunch of visual mods, and I usually mod the shit out of games, but this one I didn't think needed it (plus the stock game already stresses out my computer haha). I played Metal Gear Solid V just before Fallout and the graphics are approximately equally good in my opinion. 

RPG elements are about par for the Bethesda course, in fact probably a little better than usual. New Vegas was probably the best in this regard, since you can choose widely different factions and they have very interesting pros and cons (New Vegas wasn't Bethesda though). This game has a little bit less variation between the factions, but it's still fairly interesting.

In my opinion Fallout 4 was very good. Not the best game ever, but extremely fun and had me addicted for about 70 hours solid. Now, I played New Vegas and Skyrim for about 200/300 hours each, but then again those have been out for a long time. But to the question "is it even good?" My answer is an emphatic, "Yes!"

I've had a playthrough with everyone except Aurelia.  If and when you do decide to fire up TPS I have maybe some tips of who to play.  It might drastically change your overall experience of the game (but then again it might not depending on what you loved most about BL2). Nisha was probably my least favorite character (outside of Aurelia).  Her special was too OP and took away a lot of fun.  Wasn't much of a challenge with her.  Athena was enjoyable, but I found her to be a different experience than most of the other characters. 

* Handsome Jack Doppelganger.  One of my favorite characters in TPS.  Has a very cool action skill, his lines of dialogue are quite entertaining, and can solo.  Unless you absolutely hated Handsome Jack as a character, this one is a must play as.
* Wilhem.  I'd compare him to Axton only except his turret flies.  Probably isn't going to make you laugh.  Character itself was pretty plain.  Wish they would have explored him more considering what he had become in BL2.  Wolf and Saint absolutely crush enemies in TPS. Also, is relatively easy for solo play.
* Claptrap.  He's either my 1st or 2nd favorite playable character in TPS.  IMO has the best commentary of all the playable characters.  His action skill (depending on who you ask) is a really nice addition and fits perfect with his character.  I really had fun with his red skill tree, which encourages a lot of use with multiple weapon types.  Handsome Jack red tree is similar, only his focuses around weapon manufacturers.  Claptrap is more of a support character though and soloing certain areas may get tricky.

While it's not exactly the same, but I felt that Firewatch also really went for an emotional response in some way. It also has a beautiful story to tell and an amazing art style.

Oxenfree is also kinda along the lines of LiS, so she might like that as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the voiced protagonist.

Fallout narratives consistently felt short because it was hard to feel strongly about cardboard cut outs with no range of motion.

I remember Christine in the DLC where she's been tortured horrifically and you should feel sorry for her but the fact that her speech consists of the game telling you what she's doing despite the fact you can see her stood still doing absolutely none of it...

It finally let them tell a decent story.

To finally beat him, tie him up and eat her in front of him to get revenge.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I enjoy playing games with a great story, open world games, and I also enjoy violent and dark games. tbh I think us girls play a lot of different games like guys do. 

but then what do i know? i barely talk to other people lmao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think I'm going to get her at least on RPG to try 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on mission 3 so far and that's pretty much the impression I get. I chose to play as Emily and her far reach is just different enough from blink too make me creative. That and I'm abusing domino like there's no tomorrow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right on. It's funny how you can make people wait like that huh. The mission before the point of no return mission, I literally went grinding for different armor, because I played the entire game with the Feline set and now it has that stupid hood, of which I am NOT a fan. I was penniless and still went grinding for the entire wolf armor, dyes included, all that while the Duchess and her guard were waiting for all of us to go get that bastard.

I really liked how the name of my girlfriend on my ankle turned out but she left me and here we are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All y'all saying "move... Move.. Move... MOVE!" when she's walking up the stairs... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember the time in Riven when you're waking back down a trail you had just walked up and that little girl runs away. Just about jumped out of my skin first time I saw that. Was not expecting anything to start moving. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember playing FFXII in when my five year old daughter walked by and watched.  I killed a guy and he fell. 

"What happened?" she asked.

"It's a sleep stick," I said.  "I hit people with it and they fall asleep."

Five minutes later she's pointing out people and animals that I need to send to bed.  Good thing there was no blood.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunate, I know. Mine did the same back in 2011, I sent her in for refurbish and its been great ever since!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What would happen if while in this self made hell she suddenly closed the portals? Would she end up crushed between the two surfaces?


Maybe someone can recreate this using a storage cube to better test the physics at play.

For a second i thought the camera was about to do a loop around to her behind, but instead all i got was disappointment.

I think they forgot to shop the hand holding her knee out of the picture where she's leaning forward.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did the girl on the left actually unzip her sweater half way and then turn it around?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agreed. I don't play, but my wife does. We went for a nice 5k walk yesterday with our dog. Where its busy, and full of houses/businesses poke galore. During the 2 miles of empty trail was empty dreams for her

Right, but part of that information should be "this is VR, don't run away from things that aren't real".

I don't see many people having this issue of having "involuntary" responses like she did. VR would be doomed otherwise.

In GTA IV I shot a coffee cup out of some chicks hand when she went to take a drink. She stared at it on the ground until I shot her in the head.

I nearly cried when my teacher took away my Godzilla tomagachi. I gave her "you better give that back" eyes the rest of the day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she doesn't know what to do with her body and what she got in her hand. A puppy indeed like someone already said.

The face of a woman who just realized she's in a small space with fifteen men who are drinking and rowdy.  The only one with a closed mouth, for the patriarchy has silenced her.

Ok let's try and break it down piece by piece. Let's say for the sake of example we follow the experiment as presented in the video but we stop the pistons suddenly when the distance between the two is exactly the height of chel? Does she keep accelerating after her feet have landed on her shoulders or would she slow down? And after we decide on what happens then, what happens when we move the pistons together an inch? A foot?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she still could say that because 1 inch can't make her mouth full
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She'd break the tramp-oline.

Even if they did name it after her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sorry, but the girl is ~~pretty much~~ exactly my dream girl. Fuck. Now I have to find her doppelg√§nger and if it's the last thing I do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try something like skyrim where she can move around freely in the world. Or maybe even something like the walking dead from telltale.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wife said she was turned off by the:

&gt; giant walls of text

In Final Fantasy series.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd leave my girlfriend for this, if I had one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's 3rd girl is 1st, 1st girl is 2nd, and so forth, making the youngest looking last place
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife thought this was real. I was going on about the tightened muscles causing his arm to lash back violently. She almost threw up when she saw it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Grandma is on the phone, she wants her living room back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Better that than having a crush on naked fish girls like me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah she found a time machine went back in time and got tore in half.

Spoiler alert btw.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
as she experiences the terror of an existential crisis while falling through a virtual desk, her light up shoes blink once more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man everything you just said about her were all the things that really turned me on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP made a nightmare room and stuck a nice old junkie/prophet inside. Or they built the room around her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah my girlfriend had the same problem with the same game. That area in the Kokiri village where you walk across a bridge with no guard rail she was constantly falling off. And when she finally made it across and had to turn 90 to go to the next section...she fell.  
Then I asked if I could see, having never played before and walked across first try no problem.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does no one see that the woman is actually standing with her arms in front of her, clasped together?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I lost it when they showed her sitting in mid air swinging her foot and then panned to the actress chilling on her phone in a chair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well can I take her home and sit her on my desk I could use a sexy AI
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn, great Winston play. You fucked them up and didn't let falling off the edge stop you. Also I liked at the end when you were taking that d.va out and you stopped to kill the other lower health squishy in the room next to her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she doesn't like it when you are done, then you have to hang it on *your* wall. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lets build a chair only a 75lb woman can sit in without breaking it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was standing outside the upscale hospital in Vinewood when I witnessed a male NPC walk up to a female NPC who was on the phone. The male waited until the female was done with her conversation then asked if he could have a cigarette. She gave him one and he walked further down to a group of people and asked for a light, they gave him one, they all stood around smoking and then everyone dispersed. I'll never forget that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he/she lands in a bale of hay and walks away, I will at that moment get and leave the cinema....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd be more concerned to be sitting like that girl on the ledge. Seems like she's sitting "Indian style". If for some reason she went over the edge there'd be no way to control how she'd land. In contrast, the dude by the window could at least break the fall with his legs (and break his legs).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's when you invite her to leave, and if she refuses, advise her an official trespass complaint with the police makes a great piece of art to frame in the computer room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Literally moments after I put my Vive on my grandmas head to let her try out VR, she popped me in the face with one of the controllers. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  It can take her from being 7ish heads 

Tracer and head 7 times, you say?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why I have legitimate concerns about the safety of VR. What happens if she ran through a balcony door or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had the hands of a 9 year old girl, but the police took them as evidence. 

____________________ TOPIC 2 ______________________________

This probably wasn't what she meant when she said "I want you inside me."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't care that much but I also don't believe you. Does she consider you get boyfriend? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, he is the only guy there so she isn't wrong 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you serious?  How the fuck does someone's ability have anything to do with whether or not their opinion is valid?

First off, their opinion was not in the video, as there is no commentary.  

Second, he/she is not showing or telling someone how to play.  It's literally just them playing.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't one of the devs comment on the ending saying her accepting his lie was her way of realizing she knows she can't rely on him to do everything in her life? 

I feel like she has to know he's lieing and now she realizes she can't trust him for everything in her life and needs to take more charge of her own life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've never played it (though I think that may change soon.) but I'm assuming that it's not supposed to be as easy as she makes that look? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope. That's an after titties sort of convo. Unless you are a pro. Don't mention it until she's already attached
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well its not the stubborness its more that she is presented as a perfect character with no flaws
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;All I know is there are two theories to arguing with women and neither one works.

John Marston
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I knew she was selfish before we got married, but my gosh, I had no idea it would be this bad!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based on her opinion of Snowden, I could *totally* see that happening
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if ellie kills Joel after she finds out :O
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I honestly still can't believe people care about mobile games this much. Nothing against it, don't get me wrong, a game is a game. Its just crazy to an old lady like me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree with the girl, it as always better to play someone else's game. So you could just play for a while and move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We must find solace in the fact that she's intentionally making herself miserable by lying to herself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You claimed widowmaker's not supposed to kill people in the objective. I told you she is. That's because you can do more than one thing at once. If you only do one thing and ignore the others, you ARE playing wrong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
NOLF gets a series. Not really, But I like to think that Cate Archer was a codename and now She goes by Mallory Archer and her and her son are spies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is there no need to qualify it? If the context was altered and a woman was in place of Geoff then I guarantee the reception would be different.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Understood, I am looking a for a game that I could get my girlfriend interested in.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Poor Gary, hits it then quits it as she totally one night stands him. I was sad when Garys witcher senses could no longer follow the scent of lilac and gooseberry
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then she pointed out that I killed it faster than anyone else. I thought she was lying and CC would be ok!

I thought *sob* it was a lie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish I could've seen it but part of me thinks Ellie knew when she asked anyway, she's not stupid. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has just seen me play it and she knows nothing on it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it's not like she has anything better going on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, if they're having Joel dead it would rather be that he acts more like Ellie's moral subconsciousness, she seems pretty angry in the trailer, and having a group of raiders kill Joel seems like the only thing that would set her off unto a quest for vengeance

They could have them kill the people in the town Joel and Ellie arrive at in the end of the first game, but I would think then that Joel would be the angry one and Ellie be the voice of reason. When Joel is being the voice of reason and Ellie is the angry one, it seems fully possible that Joel is already dead
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she knew everything, but needed Joel to lie to her so it wouldn't weigh on her conscience. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No no, I was unsure who she was supposed to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You poor girl you have no idea the can of worms you've opened up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Considering she said this almost a decade ago when nearly all senators were against Vidja games  I doubt anyone cares really
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she stood up to every challenge, no matter however demanding.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Him and the girl on the other side. They both do the exact same thing with the exact. Same. Timing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;"But possibly another woman on the ballot who may be a tad bit crooked."

Trump's toupee?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No one has said it yet? Fine I will. *clears throat*

r/upvotedbecausegirl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gott be careful with your plorts man :( same thing happened to my girlfriend and she was devastated 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope you informed her that, had she looked into it, she coulda gotten up to ten times that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; there are female characters in Star Wars Battlefront . It's true to the source material.

Is it really though? The game is based off the original movies, and I don't remember seeing any female soldiers or officers on either side aside from Leia. If there were any, there weren't many of them, definitely not enough to really justify complete player freedom.

I don't mind the women in Battlefront, but to say that it's accurate and true to the source material is just wrong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then at the end the kid she's with gets infected and turns and Ellie has to kill him/her. Ellie realizes the selfishness of Joel's (and her own) decision to not try and cure the disease and Ellie ends up sacrificing herself to some entity that was an antagonist throughout the game?  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I killed her so many times doing this on purpose ... don't judge me :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You now even misunderstanding the very simple phrase "This is my photo" do you honestly think I meant she would own all the rights to that photo?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Considering all the male characters are just lady fanservice I'm okay with this
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know exactly when the video is from, and I don't care enough to go look it up, but she says "As a mom and a Senator". She hasn't been a senator for over a decade, so I am pretty sure this is way before the email scandal, either of her presidential runs, or anything else going on right now.
 

Knowing Hillary, I'm sure her position on this will have changed the second popular opinion on the subject did =P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't say she's a mutant but she's definitely a moaner.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She knew that the whole time. She basically says so in the very end. It's what she wanted. If you don't get that then you need to replay it. Also the leader of the fireflies was basically her second mother and very clearly cared for Ellie. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Has anyone else noticed that Pharah's eyes seem to change color when she blinks?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thats Hellla true you hella said girl damn y u so right all the time right on point hella true that is hella hella hella hella
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
obviously she was coerced by The Patriarchy^TM as women cannot make their own decisions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact that she probably doesn't know anything about Pokemon and did this just to see the joy that her grandkid would get out of receiving it makes it so heartwarming.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I do agree with the sentiment, you're making a lot of assumptions about OP's girlfriend. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the most emotional scene was Joel and Ellie discussing Sarah after she runs away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not stopping him/her from drawing whatever they want. Like the person I replied to, I think it stands out - that's not a criticism though. 

____________________ TOPIC 3 ______________________________

Isn't he the boss at the end of the bunny girl area too?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's really crazy. Mine was the same. Although it was call of duty which is probably a bit of a harder game to play if you've never really gamed. But yeah she couldn't work out how to look or move properly, always ended shooting into the air. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In fairness, she didn't miscarry because the baron attacked her. His attacking her made her want to miscarry so she asked the Crones who obliged and turned the baby into a botchling!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, the infamous [Ming Xiao temple](/spoiler) was  pretty shit. Yet I was definetely able to go through it with Jaegerspas and Magnum revolver as Toreador. Boss was hard, but then I understood that [you don't have to worry avout adds as only one will grow at a time. Used celerity to dodge attacks and used like 2 blood packs staying at a close range near the back of Ming. Killed her in like two minutes.](/spoiler) And then things got even easier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*Missile blows up in front of her and throws her into brick wall*

"Ouch!"

*keeps running.* 

Lara is a fucking trooper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Turns out she hit up, up, down, down, l, r, l, r, b, a, start and cheated on him.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love playing her. I don't understand why more people don't. She is not the best tank but she has this tank / support thing going on that is very strong and her damages can be huge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
her ult wasn't the stun, you can see the stun in the bottom right as one of her abillities, her ult is the damage booster she used on the rein because after she used it her ult meter was at 1%
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vicar punishes you for playing safe. If you play aggro she won't usually try to heal. Also, with the dlc, there is an NPC summon that will tank her for you. Don't even need the dlc to summon him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He keeps looking back and forth at Lydia like: "Are you seeing this?". And she's like: "I didn't do it stop fucking looking at me"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is. She doesn't take damage but she still takes knockback and hitstun.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thinks it's more supposed to be the stereotypical magical girl transformation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really? As DVA I've been destroying him (and.. well everyone) in fights. I think she's the more broken of the two. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got the same endrb√∫a spelling, but couldn't find any correlation anywhere. If its correct, good find. Where did you come by a translation?

Also, after her kills the giant, the next area seems to have two words spelled in runes. Did you check those out at all?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Final Fantasy XV. I was fighting this chick and she was kicking my ass, so I activated my super attack. I started doing work and she jumped into the air. Not to be outdone, I followed her. And then that quick little fight scene happened. Just beautifully well done. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can actually fight her In the beginning after you get the banner to fly away after the second boss. But after you get the banner if you keep hitting her she turns into the dancer then lol she fucks you up. Well fucked me up a least so underleveled 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"At once dude" 

"Psh, PASS. I'm not trying to get a nobody. Get me a girl that has hit triple digits"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Personally I was annoyed with what happened to Samus with the zero suit because it took her away from being some 6 foot plus amazonian warrior. If the zero suit never happened then Other M might not have happened.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and she drops her soda right before getting hit.  Now that's some detailed shit.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll bite the bullet and volunteer to be locked underground with her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus she doesn't die, which is why I always brought her with me. She's like Shadowmere that shoots things
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How come she get health back if it's not time?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is also completely defenseless and has no offensive ability other than to stop healing and take out her gun. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
never got the lydia lovefest. she died for me taking on some witches. thats when i realised she ain't about that life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It'll be recharged by the time she runs back basically
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only full if she was full 4 seconds prior. Otherwise it heals her to that point. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lingerie Hockey League. Where guys with a battered woman fetish go to see girls covered in bruises from blocking shots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I kind of thought it was neat how you could determine your level of handicap going in to that final fight, too.  Example being, rush straight to her door and you can only auto attack.  On the other hand, it could be annoying on subsequent games to unlock all your abilities.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
McCree is great to protect the payload against flankers like Reaper, Tracer and Genji while still having great ranged damage with his left click.

Pharah is good to stay around the payload because her long range and high damage allowing her to deal high damage behind Reinhardt's shield while quickly going up in the air in team fights.

Not that the offense or defense really matters because Hanzo and Widow are used on offense a lot more than defense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women in battle is just taking it too far 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but there's a delay. I'm suggesting that she should be able to immediately restore that if the ability is up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you hit the wall button again it shatters.  If Mei dies before she can do that then it stays for the full timer.  Your Mei just sucks and is cancer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus she gives you ammo and health so thats a bonus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if Metroid actually *was* a girl in the games?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet she plays Symmetra and puts the teleporter on the edge of a cliff...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Use black Knight shield and hug her, blocking for the aoe.

Can kill her with almost no damage taken for the whole fight. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd argue her alt fire is defensive as well, since it moves so slow but bypasses shields and continues on through targets makes it less of an offensive attack and more of an area denial technique.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not in my experience. Low on salts, she gets me salts. Low on ammo, she gets me ammo. Dying, she gets me a medpac. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of it has to do with the fact that her head shot placement is like front and center and super easy to hit. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now you know her special ability. But wall hack is when I can see through walls and obstacles when I shouldn't be able to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SPOILER:

no spider-man debunked that myth when Gwen was dropped from a high point and bounced off the ground but spiderman caught her before the  second bounce and she still ded
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lucio or Zenyatta depending on the map and if we're attacking or defending. Soldier 76 is the only offensive char I'm even half decent with, and I can play DVA in a pinch, but I'm terrible with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's cause she's furrowed her eyebrows in the second one  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I did that (within days of release) the game glitched out and I wasn't able to leave the area. He attacked her,  the guards attacked him,  spell wore off, but she hit him again so the guards attacked her.  She was killed eventually,  but I couldn't exit the area. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Brutal! The car that hit her lost the bumper but didn't even slow down!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's correct, but her flash is another evasive maneuver that decreases even more incoming damage, and lets her heal more often than Bastion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'd fight Mom and people after her. More of the game unlocks the more you play. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Press E, or whatever you have her wall skill on, again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dancer is one of those bosses I've never had trouble with. Everything she does is pretty telegraphed, and she's not very fast. Just keep hitting and keep running.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the Sprite the one with the offensive spells? Because if so, I'm pretty sure that's a "she" not "he".

____________________ TOPIC 4 ______________________________

Once, by a member of the PMS clan in Halo 2. Those girls could kick ass and they were not shy about letting people know that you got your ass kicked by a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cait is used to injecting hard pricks into her. ;D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like Jenova should be a queen, and Yuffie should not, because fuck her for stealing my materia.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one that really wants to punch that bitch in her face?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's gotta be handy for livestreaming the girl tied up in your basement 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It wouldn't be the same without her laughing. It's like a laugh track, but at least 56x better. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man I feel bad for the girl because the game will just crash.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;what she said about you're about road and her's.

About your road and hers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Makes me wonder if her ass looked any better with the Justin Bailey code.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought that girl was going the land back in the jeep somehow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now I want to see someone who has a fetish with naked girls whose heads are litterally train cars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dont forget solas although you have to be a female elf
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that a bottle of lubricant on her bat belt? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clickers bite into her neck with blood gushing everywhere and all over her face while she screams
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I used Jun I'd get going on her combos and never stop. So much rage I'd incur. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no she didn't. 

everyone knows women can't take pictures without them in it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know, there are creepier things she could be laughing her head off at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's so good at hacking, she doesn't need to flip her head ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Queen of pain eh? So she is.. hurtin for a squirtin?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;!my 

So it's not *your* name that's Trevor. No wonder she jumped
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you look on other parts of the pictures than her ass, you might get lucky. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not a single woman in the room! This game is going to kick ass
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, I wish they had more of the music from the cut scenes and will always go back and hog tie women for the train gods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want front row seats to her sweet butt trumpet symphony and a backstage tour of the orchestra pit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was itchin to get in on it. You can see the blood lust in her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is that a part of her vag or her crotch?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Steal the car get a prozzie, intercorse her moot hole, tell her to think about what she's done.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When i got to this part in game i was on my knees begging her to take the rest of it off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
put your cock next to her face and see if she can smell it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then tell her to put up the sticks, yet to find a 3 year olds whoes ass I couldn't kick.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, they just flipped her around and figured no one would notice?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she goes feral shadow or whatever it really creeps me out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So where does she get cars to run people over?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I keep accidentally chopping her face off with my axe. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's not nearly angular enough to pull it off. There's not a single point on her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was convinced of that after the first scene when she puts in the earbuds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That final kick at the end... Willing to instantaneously catch himself on fire just to kick a dead guy for accidentally punching a girl. Gotta love a guy with morals.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was on a bike ride with my wife the other day and started pretending to kick her bike and yelled "road rash!". 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she got addicted to skooma man... skoomaheads will do that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was wondering the same thing, it's just a picture and she doesn't even look mildly amused.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I kind of chuckled when the character in the red sweater just knocks that girl down as he goes by, and she falls.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she die from getting Falcon Punched in the face or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Can the girl NOT smell Charlie?  Can the guy NOT see...Dee?" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll clap because I'll get a car, and she'll get a car and you get a car
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or when it verbally assaulted its interim CEO only for her to have done absolutely nothing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess its time to cut ties with her. It was a good run!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The zipper running down the crack of her ass is a key part of this cosplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how he knocks her over with the binder.  Women love binders.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shotgun to the back of the witches head kills her instantly if i remember rightly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the person in the car is a girl, but it looks like she's in the passenger seat, so the car probably belongs to the guy filling up the car 

____________________ TOPIC 5 ______________________________

I don't have it in me to call her a bitch haha. But I've always called her a punk since she was a kid. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;i bet the ladies are all up on.  

I like to place my grace in their tact tracts.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that girl needs to play more pokemongo and eat less doritos
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but she has a surface to deploy the bipod on. That's how it works in game as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is her look so empty? Kinda looks like a puppet or if she is daydreaming
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think they are closed, actually. They are painted on her eyelids, no?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my corpses. 

Cold and rotting. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not disputing any of your points, and actually you've made me want to rewatch the show again. But on the surface it looks girly - I've had to push and push just to get my SO to watch a few episodes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks. I'm going to see if she's got anything I can beat off to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea but who is Yennifer and why do I want to find her so bad?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a gentleman, so I use my Likitung on her Cloyster before charging in there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, it is quite comfy. My wife steals it a lot, even though she has a few she made for herself 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's probably cheating on you too, if anything has been for years 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet Mongo, whoever she/he/it is, does not like to get poked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always thought Granny was kinda lying. Tetra is pretty dishonest and she sees it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kylo Ren was a bitch. But of course they needed a bitch-villain even a woman could defeat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I totally hated that bitch before she was annoying at E3"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gasp! Your girlfriend is actually El Blanco Magnifico, the greatest women's wrestler of all time!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, theres a seam only where her vagina would be but her vagina is invisible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ive hated preston from the moment i met him. Hate that annoying woman who bitches a lot as well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me and my crew did her while you were sniffing glue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not even trolling, but does she by chance have autism
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because someone is girly doesn't mean they can't like other things too. I don't see why a Girly Girl would object to, say, Sorry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't worry, it's Cinnabon frosting. They're trying to find out where she hid the other Cinnabons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell. I swear she's been eating a lot of Taco Bell lately...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet that isn't even the skull of her real mother.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every time she mentions her vagina I just fucking lose it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she cheated on you? You just gonna let that happen??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet she is super annoying to be around at a con. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I sure do like when girls do that thing where they get naked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tina, always bothering me. Asking for "lunch recommendations"...you know what she really wants to do at lunch.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The white paint is actually glue. That's why she can climb it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the bottom half of her is a giant spider. some people are really into that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well yea I get that but how was she "changing" they way we gamed?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet this puffled her jiggles when she found out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, she tries hard to get what she's looking for.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What happen to her nipple? Did you bite it off?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha good thing I'm a woman ;)

It looks neat, thanks!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; [Bitch I got a life and a girl to fuck.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But what about when she eats. What happens to her lunch if she time travels. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One of the few singleplayer games I've bothered to finish (TR 2013). I absolutely adored it too and loved what they did with the her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that by that dumb bitch that uses her vagina to get people to watch her videos? Because there's no other reason that shit should be viral.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still need to actually finish all the routes. My girlfriend is farther through than I am.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's built like a pro wrestler!

...

Is she a pro wrestler?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is what I put Marcy in. It makes her bitching funnier. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are, on one boys have a penis and on the other girls have a vagina.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe she just finished it and was trying it on? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always hated playing against ivy. Av friend of mine mastered her just to spite me. To be fair I mastered Voldo top spite him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks.  I just want her to do her own thing, so I let her do what she wants for the most part.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's actin like a bitch because she does it soo well.

____________________ TOPIC 6 ______________________________

Not trying to argue about if said concerns are valid. Just that they'd have infinitely more impact on the average woman then how they are portrayed in *fictional* media.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
GTA isn't a great example as you can easily make a black female character in the multiplayer, and go and mow down millions of white men. So it's easy to point out that it's equally racist and sexist towards everyone!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
boo...violet hold is major suckage. Is she using a Doomgaurd? please tell that women to spec into sacrifice. Lurn2play nub...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rosalina is Peach's daughter from the future, and Luigi is her father. But that's just a theory.  
  
A GAAAAME THEEORRYYYY.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Violent video games increase aggression as much as lead lowers IQ. What is the conversion metric here? Is aggression now quantified in IQ? The only reason she even mentions this is to make the connection of giving games to kids is like making them eat lead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One person (me) is a sufficient counterexample, but it's not exactly as if this is a novel claim I'm making. Lots of men, including evolutionary psychologists, have claimed that men have lower standards than women. It's not just me saying it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's Blindspot that does it the most, as it causes her to be in New York to film for large portions of the year. The rest of them are able to maintain the show and their other work because it's all based out of L.A.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Making an argument for how men are portrayed in media is a different discussion than how women are portrayed. While both are good discussions to have, one does not discuss the colors of apples when talking about the colors of oranges.

You're not alone in taking this approach, and I am not attempting to belittle you. It just seems strange to speak of badly thought out arguments using a badly thought out argument.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure there is, he has racial quotas! Gotta have that office diversity. /s

Affirmative Action is racist in itself. I don't see how they can't see that forcing an elevation of a group of people isn't in itself racist, because it implies that they can't get it otherwise. 

Equality of opportunity, not outcome, you know? Let the best man win. Or woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just got a new Indian coworker, I'm going to show her how we do things in america.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"This is me when she says she likes guys who are violent because they play video games."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It really is fascinating. As she makes these paintings she is also studying the culture and has been trying to incorporate little nods to the culture wherever she can. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It doesn't matter when they do it.  What I"m saying is, if people were truly about representation like they say they are, we would be seeing more specifics requests for representation of groups of people who are rarely, if ever represented in games.

Now, if you're going to start talking about ratios (more women than black people), then there are more men in the industry who make games and more guys who play console games like Zelda and as such, Link should stay a male character to represent those who actually play the games more.  As such, people shouldn't get upset that people want Link to stay male.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't represent the real female form. When are we going to have a chubby Queen?     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost a foot above average height for women in most western countries, and all the women I know above 6' jokingly call themselves amazons.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a 5'6 male, I weigh about 180 and I can tell you she shouldn't be so chunky, it's the clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does a MacGuffin.

Just because her role is important doesn't make it substantial or representative or even a protagonist's role.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I told my colleagues and they learnt to accept it. I'm a 28 year old who works in a female dominated office. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is true for anything not just Americans though. Females like to be able to play as a woman in the game. African Americans like to see some sort of representation as do gays. Everyone wants to see someone that they can relate to
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But since it was a pussy pass topic she thought like that because of gender.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For real?! If it was a white girl who said something like that about a black girl you really don't think that would be an issue?....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't like $Hillary either, but this was 20 years ago and she had self-described "experts" telling her it was true. Although that whole "Video games increase aggressive behavior as much as lead poisoning decreases IQ" is as hilarious a statement as I could ever think of. So are we talking percentage points or the ratio of IQ points to percentile of aggressive behavior? Lol.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Video games are international, and according to that logic kids in every country where video games are played should be as violent as in USA (according to her logic). The problem with violence is not video games, it's something else.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure half of you in this thread are children, so this is probably going to fall on deaf ears, but you people should really take a gender studies course. The way that you people are minimizing/discounting real problems concerning female representation in video games is quite honestly abhorrent. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We live in a sexist world. Just because I guy can shoot it, doesn't mean a girl can't flick it. Move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is Donkey Kong her favorite game or is it one of the others?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, this series perplexes me so much. I think it's inarguable that MGS has a problem with over-sexualizing women, but simultaneously, the overwhelming majority of female characters are incredibly strong and resourceful, and frequently even superior at what they do when compared to their male counterparts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she was campaigning based off some bullshit about how (cherry picked no doubt) studies have shown that violent videogames create violent adults and compared it to lead poisoning.

There is no link between playing violent games and being violent proven so far, so she's deliberately misinforming parents in her attempt to inform them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*And not just the men.  But the women.  And the Children to.  They're like animals, and you SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE ANIMALS!*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not disagreeing with that, really. Bad writing is an issue. But portrayal of people in general, men and women, do help to define our culture, what we define as 'ideal' for men and women, not only in how they look but also how they act, and when this happens a lot in media, it can lead to bad habits or self-image issues. And I do take issue with that. That's not an issue limited to women, but that's what the discussion is focused on so I just weigh in on that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hale was also the voice of the 90s Spiderman character Black Cat, and most of the female parts of 90s childhoods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
.... said every girl ever when this topic comes up.

I see no issue with that, only wish i had her name... for..yaknow, research.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was worried they were going to make Mario see a female orgasm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I totally agree. I feel like the people that are losing their shit over it set this up into a black and white, us or them mentality. Even in that narrative their logic flawed.

Blizzard can do whatever it wants. I will support this game with a preorder because of its diverse cast and excellent portrayal of women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's their game you fucking crybaby, if you don't like it don't buy it or go make your own game. Your opinion doesn't, and will never, matter.

There isn't a black protagonist in Zelda, all the characters are white. How come you want a white female and not a black female? Are you racist? What a bigot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He does have a fedora on. His just treating m'lady how ask her chads treat her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There never is both, coming from. A country where talking about honour related violence against women is considered racist and islamophobic by the same people calling for "mantax" makes one slightly biased..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My bad.  I was thinking of her as Gwen Stacy, who is like 17.  

...

Which kind of shows the problem--the audience would be likely to think of her as a babe in arms too.  Like I said--it'd be creepy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe it's an objection to the way the government treats women in the country? 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The whole "anti-SJW" movement seems to be mostly men who are afraid of getting rejected by women because of their aggressive courting attempts anyway. It's like how white people in the South think that the Black Live Matters protestors are going to literally kick their doors down and berate them for being religious, or whatever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was finding Nemo pass topic she thought because of her favourite film
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she claims its backed up by '40 years of research' and this video can be seen as an indicator on her general stance towards the medium.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For fucks sake...the girl and the tiger...I couldn't even watch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet another unrealistic standard of beauty for women in video games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; women aren't as biased towards looks as men are
 
You don't actually believe this, do you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can still tell it's a white girl and black guy!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're horribly mislead. The wage gap doesn't exist (there is an *earnings* gap, which does not factor in things like hours worked, job positions, etc) but for the exact same work a woman would be payed the same amount as a man. 

On the other front, we have the police killing black people. Only 15% of America's population is black. They are responsible for 50% of America's violent crime, and 25% of police murders are black people. It's pretty clear that it isn't being black that causes police to kill people, it's committing violent crimes. And as it happens, black people commit more violent crime (relative to their population %). This is not racism. These are statistics.

There are a few cases of indiscriminate police killing of blacks (which I in no way support - it is disgusting regardless of the race of the victim) which are blown massively out of proportion by activists and the media, when in fact most of the indiscriminate police killing victims are white.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;true feminism is about equality

there is a reason why every dictionary defines feminism as being pro-women either exclusively or at least as primary meaning.

Historically since birth of the movement it has **never** been about equality for all genders. Even in speeches mentioning equality it was always in context of making sure women were treated no less than men, but never the other way around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
congrats now you know how the rest of us feel when they cast a Scot to play an Egyptian and cast a white girl to play a Japanese person...This is where you get the answer the rest of us minorities get...get over it. 


Feel better Now? No, I know you don't.

____________________ TOPIC 7 ______________________________

Except the game doesn't end when the female dies. It ends when the male becomes impotent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No worries, man. Or woman....or human....errr, you know what I mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well that is because some angels are girls as well 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do not like the game either, she did not like the workplace and quit halfway through to work on another game. I just found the motive beatiful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, it doesn't have to be two girls. There are many variegated and deep combinations of futa...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mass Effect or should I say mass erect. Amirite ladies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's also mostly filler creating that effect though. Much like a girls eyebrows. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Since I recently played The Evil Within, I was completely immune to any horror they create.  If you haven't played The Evil Within, the spider demon women in that game are just insanely more horrific and terrifying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks fantastic, but I can't stop looking at her boomerang eyebrows.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When Jenny (your girlfriend) dies in front of you because you are being held, powerless, by the darkness. And then you kill yourself just to wake up in hell. Game: The Darkness 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like Olive Oil trying to get Popeye to save her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean criticising a woman is not sexist, doing death threats is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was like four or something. I think she dies in one of them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jill, hopefully. It's been way too long since she was the start of a main Resident Evil. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Dwarf Fortress, men and women look exactly the same.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder if she will still have her invisibility powers in 2
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thought that was Brit Murphy at first; "she's still alive?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She only dies if you give her the killing blow. No mobs can kill her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she's not recalling far enough to before she got dressed. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hi, can you PM me your organization and location? My wife works at an independent living facility and she may be interested in this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's women all over the planet. Have you tried looking for them instead? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like that moment in Mass Effect when I punched that female reporter...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why didn't they get her to do the live action film?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell, I'll take it if you don't want it. My girl loves Frozen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that poor woman just wanting to get to the other building had to die
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she does seem to be the games' "Ryu" by looking at the rest of her moveset.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The three females I've played with the most main a female troll, a female orc, and a female tauren. They aren't teenagers, go figure :b
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Itman : Absolution. You must save the girl from becoming it, the best tag game of all time
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Alarm + fireworks was mass mayhem too. Also useful for unleashing hell in the girl's dorm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Another pretty universal law for that game is that if there's a girl talking in the lobby, there's ALWAYS a guy trying to impress her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this a spartan 4 or a spartan 2?

That name is confusing the hell out of me. If its a 2, she shouldnt have a full name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He saved earth but released her as a side effect. It's why we see her 2 seconds in AC4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh look..

It's the girl from the last of us, beyond 2 souls, life is strange, resident evil lesbians..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you think that she's a robot in the first place!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the transition.

"Follows law perfectly."

"Finds explosives."

The rest is implied.  There aren't many intact vehicals in her save are there?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Deep and dank, just like how I like my women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cause her faith is her armour, you don't need armour when Elune herself protects you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Negative, she was just evil and betrayed Tyrael whilst killing Leah to help Diablo breach the heavens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I don't recall how far along she is, but she wasn't all woman at the start.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man I never landed a parry on that dude and she can do it blindfolded.  Impressed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I want to play a game. Let's play, Hide and Seek. Those were her exact words."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she had taken my sega, though, i would have gone to jail for murder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet Hitler would be shedding tears right now if her were watching this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he was the bad guy in the first game too.  That guy could have saved humanity and so many other girls like Ellie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Halo is my childhood.

Cortana is my fucking BAE (well, Chief found her first, but she's still mine too).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
301 spartations, has a sex scene with her in it.

Wasn't really interested in the rest of the movie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's an invisibility cloak, but it only makes you invisible to women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did he... did he just fuck her to death ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Correct! You'd either need to restart or try again on NG+ (which is effectively restarting). 

Protip: don't let her die.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but Priscilla had more of that innocent girl feeling to her

____________________ TOPIC 8 ______________________________

Find out who among the three you like. Get the same tattoo as hers done but with the colors inverted. Tell her: "You complete me."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't. It was an assumption.

Though, if she didn't make it, then she could also not apply her own face paint, which would then not require any effort from her as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If only he put that much effort into finding a girlfriend
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
maybe its milk :/ especially if she's a mother like i said...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But men lack the ~~mammory~~ ~~mamory~~ *specific internal boob-organs* that women have.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've always wondered but... how the hell do you get a scar in a curvy-snake like shape? It's like someone was doing an autopsy on her and got creative.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In [Soul Calibur V]( her wardrobe was toned down a bit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And it's rockin style. Don't let your girlfriends tell you any different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at the expanse of skin in the upper-ass, lower-back region.

That is *definitely* a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you send me a hair off her head for.. Reasons. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cut down like so many japanese schoolgirls in the night...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does it have hair? In FF7 her "hair" was just the wires attached to the thing on her head
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
however, at least in icelandic, and probably old norse, she would need to add an 'r' to the Valhalla, so that it would make grammatical sense... "Til Valhallar" would be "To Valhalla" in old norse / iceland... I'm not sure about norwegian/danish/sweedish/faroese but if I recall correctly it works the same way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what you didn't realize is that her sports bra is also a makeshift smelter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Japanese women tend to be very small. It's not as uncommon as you mite think. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apparently she was pretty or had some pretty large physical features
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure where you got the idea that men and women have such different postures. [They]( [don't]( Structurally, they're strikingly similar barring their proportions. Perhaps you, too, have just grown accustomed to the way they're always presented?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's still a Cid in FFXV, so in Japan it's Cid and Cidney.

Similar to in FFV, when Cid had a grandson, Mid.

I'm not sure why they changed Cidney to Cindy in the US/EU. Cidney (Sidney) is a common enough English female name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she wants to do it by hand that makes sense, world edit would have been useful tho :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you base her stats on her file in game?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fair enough on her reasoning, but it doesn't make it any less rapey.  Not at all.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just practicing for his little girls sleepover.... Light as a feather stiff as a board
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; His abilities

I thought Tone was a She.

(Ion, Tone and Northstar have female voices)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably a reference to some people, and he/she is speaking to them, hence the word "you".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Someday, I want a woman who is as turned on by something oddly specific as you are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd say a lot of women do. I'm not one personally, but I've referred several acquaintances to it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are correct. You can use frame by frame in VLC to see her tail and wings more clearly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is a perfect example, especially if you want to co-op with her. It can be challenging but more brain teasing than actually difficult. A+ suggestion
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was hard to do Cammy, her hair keeps getting in the way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She also looks at a little holographic projection in one of her emotes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if you're referring to that one of the anime chick with semen all over her face that was incredibly poorly shooped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess she though it was just a bit .... too real 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a guy that likes a lot of things that are considered feminine. My personality has also been called pretty in-between masculine and feminine. So I like to create girl characters as a way to sort of physicalize how in-between my nature is. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dont see the short hair and long hair thing.


Edit: nvm i see it, a woman in the rock
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
mine has as well

you can remove MOST of the greyish color in the advanced skin color picker (were you pick 5 different layers of color)

i changed my bright blue faced female char to a bit more blushy red, that was the best i could do, even though the skin color i picked originally was regular Caucasianish 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to extend my reach to her stars above...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh it looks nice but the aspect ratio is off. They need to take this image and stretch it along the X axis by like a handful of pixels because it looks like her head was squished:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Does not tell." True but to be fair, most women have long hair and most men short. Therefore, my statement is not saying "HE MUST BE A GIRL" I said he LOOKS like a girl because as stated previously, women usually long hair and men short hair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Naw, either can be correct depending on the meaning you're going for. This dude's just correcting the sentence to fit her opinion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does she have semen leaking from her nipples?

EDIT: I know it's milk. Looks like goddamn wood glue. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if my girlfriend put that on it wouldn't be on for very long

edit: grilfriend  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
meh we all know real women look like this


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right about female muscles but Gadot doesn't look like she does anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whoa, what are the odds of finding a small woman AND a small man. Truly remarkable. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are we referring to the woman "blowing" the autopilot back up?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about male with internal genitalia for women and male with external genitalia for men?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's probably why he seems so uninterested on a *fucking anime girl*.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When do you figure she'll be done with this project?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know if she's one in particular but she's a slytherin student, you can see she has a wand on her hip.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All SF girls seem to be thick af

No complaints.

....Can she make another one? For my daughter? I might just borrow it from her now and then.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she playing it for the original DS or 3DS? I bought a 3DS just for New Leaf and it's got much more content.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep now you have a Wii U and for some odd reason in x and y if you play as a girl she starts the game holding a Pikachu 3DS.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she also makes the tags so people know that the dolls are there on purpose and that they're allowed to keep them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Back when iPhones had just come out, Grandma bought me an iPhone case for Christmas thinking it was an actual iPhone. Poor grandma thought she could buy an iPhone for $10 at CVS. Best phone case I never used! Still one of my favorite Christmas presents, just 'cause I LOVE MY GRAM GRAM!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
indeed, still love her more than anything ('cause mom). the real test is being raised around stuff like that, but not hiding behind the 'different time' or 'grew up with' excuse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom is 55 and knows nothing about pokemon. Today she told me " I killed a pokemon today at work!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He said she started making in fathers day for him so he does have children. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she's 89, she would be born the same year as the first television. So, I suppose it's possibe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is probably one of the most adorable things I've ever seen...mostly because I have a daughter (she's a 1 year old) who I gave an old DualShock2 so she could have a controller and sit with my wife and I when we play.  She's always trying to get the DS3's we're holding, so I let her join in with her own controller.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually think the woman is his daughter, not his wife...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A gift of 6 year old parts that were cobbled together from 3 different people to replace the old laptop that her parents got for work? Yeah, that family must be fucking loaded. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't the alleged mother let her underage daughter play the game?

Sounds like a breach of ToS.

Make sure you find the girl you like and tell here, "I'd like to take a pikachu".

Better get rid of her iPhone and buy an Android while she's at it too.

She loves minecraft but has trouble doing things because of the way her fingers can't reach the controls (on a controller) and I am trying to have her understand the WASD concepts :)

Thanks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I highly recommend beat hazard. My gf and i love playing it, she uses the xbox controller and i use the keyboard. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 7 years old and my mom said she will buy me any game I want

I said I want sonic on a gameboy! *(I had a sega and my friend had a gameboy, I thought it was possible)*

she gave me some LCD hand held game like one of these. At least it was sonic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't actually see the controller in her hand.  It might not even be her playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had one in my SoulSilver.... had to get rid of her for Lugia though :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seeing as she was using her parents old work laptop to play games, and now has been given 6 year old hand me down parts, I'm sure she'd like to have rich parents as well. Good thing she has a loving family though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A coworker's 8 year old son asked her for it as a gift. Blew my mind, but made happy despite not playing the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You too?! I almost had a daughter and called her Nadia (The spanish translation they gave to Jenna), but had a son instead so... Yeah

Glad to know there was people like me who loved the game this much
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I made my mom play Portal. First game she ever completed, I was very proud.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't be the first time Troy Baker has played a father figure hallucination for a female protagonist...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't have responsibilities. Just kids and a woman who tell me what to do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His mom isn't Hawaiian.  Even if she was born in Hawaii, she still wouldn't be Hawaiian. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get her another ring and see if PSVR shows up too
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she start you with the scene that had the grown kid breastfeeding?


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like the girl from The Ring bought a lambo...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While a phone can objectively do more than an old gameboy pushing buttons on touch and actually pushing buttons is a mile apart even without nostalgia. Recently my niece who used to play on her moms iPhone a lot of emulated Pokemon after seeing me play it on my NintendoDS said it's nowhere near as fun as playing it on a real Gameboy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Why is it called a GameBOY? Why can't it be called Gameboygirl?"

-asshat girl on the bottom right 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
About 7 minutes in;

"not official Sega Rom hackers who make the game easier, for you know, kids 'n women, and people who like the Nintendo Wii"

Hello burn ward? I'd like to book a room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Karen ?! .... The girl with that Nintendo thing ? NO DON'T INVITE HER PLEASE
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The same Nintendo that makes you buy the same vC game on each system? Or whereven my wife couldn't keep her ambassador games when switch her ds
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she could use a little more Pokemon go   
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a noob, why didn't she use Protect? A true Pokemon trainer knows this? Pokemon 101! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First, hold your camera the right way. Second, she's not playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just a girl to look at me like Xbox girl is looking at PS guy...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You go to her father's house and swap her for 40 gallons of pesticide.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Next they find her phone showed a ghost pokemon.
Nintendo is going too far.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mother is almost 56 and she knows all there is to know, surface-wise at least. I'm so proud :')
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
your mom told me to tell u she's proud of u
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually no, she kills him after she was already born and raised by comstock in almost every timeline. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because there has never been a story about a guy and girl or father daughter trying to make it through the world before the last of us...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For what it's worth, my Mum made me these (and a Pok√©ball) and I'm sure she'd be happy to take commissions:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Make her open the box. And that's the way you do it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The second game was way better. Just put a lady in whatever house and give her money and make as many children as you can. 

Then one day all the kids get in your way and you go on a killing rampage and then your wife gets in the way then your children are taken by the guards.

And then you try again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now I've gotta go and look up that story about the mom who played Animal Crossing and left a bunch of stuff for her son.

____________________ TOPIC 10 ______________________________

Zarya and Junkrat, altough after having played Ana, she might replace Junkrat.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every single line the bikini girls say is an innuendo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Moira was like nails on a chalkboard

I actually liked her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TBH, this is tame compared to what I've seen.

In my experience, when a girl player reveals herself the team she's on always goes out of their way to help her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm very competitive as well, if I have a child, I'd probably not let him or her win, much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His face is only like that because he was about to rank up and she ruined the match for everyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know right. I tried to show her overwatch and dota. Not a great starting point
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only reason she was standing up was because she was nailed there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seems like she'd be able to do it. You *know* she can aim. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pharah can't do that because she is insanely susceptible to good snipers. Hanzo and widowmaker can take her out of the sky ridiculously easy. If we are talking high skills games where everyone is good with the hero they are playing pharah will not be playing in a "assasin" style. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
also, dont leave your mercy behind.  
also, when mercy is around just stand there and shoot. they will/ should focus her before you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes it was. They guy was like "I have a 4 year old girl who loves to watch the trailer, and I don't want her sticking out her booty. Totally okay with her shooting people though."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In theory? Are you saying you don't know any ordinary, sane women?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the tip of the day goes to this guy/girl/genderless being. Right here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks more like the girl that does her VA now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It looks like that so the player can still see the character he's/she's controlling, are you serious?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's my guess as well, I think she's imagining him in the trailer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D.va can also nullified hanzo‚Äôs ult with her E skill
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got a widowmaker to switch hero after i killed her that way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is called No Man's Sky, so it is obviously the woman's sky.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You say you made it for her, but I think you made it for yourself, *winky face*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder what the percentage is on players with a male character vs. players with a female one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really cannot spot the third one in part 3, where's she hiding?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she finds antibiotics, she pops the top, downs the entire bottle, and still succumbs to infection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whoa there! 

I've got her in my sights ( Õ°¬∫ Õú ñ Õ°¬∫)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she hook all that shit up? That's what I'm talking about! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That chic's face says it all.  She knows she's obsolete. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about making 50shield a line of sight thing like zen's orb or lucio's healing? That would make flankers still have the measly 25shield and the those close to her have 50shield. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably to torment the players who grieved her. It's even more heartbreaking seeing her come back and having to work against her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I giggled like a little schoolgirl when 47 popped up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, Team Ninja really fucked with it all, I mean, 5'9 isn't something to scoff at, but that's half a foot from how tall she's supposed to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do her thing and then you have full right to do yours as well. It's a balance .. you give to her and she gives back to you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohhh, so maybe she turned around because the camera was pointed at her and she's trying to cover her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, I'd love to, but I know she'd give me the ‡≤†_‡≤† face
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
2 games as mercy and in one I got 4man ress. It was potg. Played ~15h this weekened ( ~120 games ) and there were at least 5 mercy potgs. At least in my games she got it more often than other supports. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Noo. That male players would ultimately be better than female players. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't tell how good it is without seeing her face. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To me the best part is the last female at the end that gets blasted across the park.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, thats kind of what widowmaker is supposed to do. pick off people to lighten the burden for the team when pushing the point. if she tries to push the point she'll just get mowed down almost instantly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also if he sees an enemy Mercy Rez her team he'll ask why it worked for them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because Katy Perry let me Aladeen all over her face!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure someone on the Football/Basketball team already has her covered.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's really encouraging. I can see the JOI on her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It can't be girls either play cod with their cleavage popping our or hearthstone also with their cleavage popping out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I was mistaken when he starts talking about Johnny's girl. 

And I will laddie!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goomba means friend in italian and Gooma means mistress.(lady friend)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well either way she is a shit team player a banana could literally support the team better than she can
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the optimistic insinuation at the end that she'll be able to pull that switch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is totally gaming right? her gaming skills are incredible!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just counter him with Moonraker Elite (b)...the girl is Oddjob-short for some reason.

____________________ TOPIC 11 ______________________________

...so she has her baby right there on the lawn?

Seems a bit...primordial...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this a hint for you to dress up like Link and give her the sausage?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It will be like a woman holding as baby cheetah?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should of rolled your eyes and said "heh, don't flatter yourself" give her something to think about 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would make sense if she got skittles with lime.  The green apple is terrible.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Do you ever wonder what if ~~Zelda~~ *Link* was a girl?

Zelda is a girl; she's the princess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She did To the Moon's [soundtrack]( as well! I love her work!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, we have no way of knowing what happened before we saved her. In any of the games. Let that sink in.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to put my Master Sword in her pedestal.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the one where you *can* kidnap her and give her to her stalker
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would detonate that shit right before she lays the last dynamites
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why not just get the rights to use Linkle? There, now we don't have to make girl Link.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she masters that then she will be ready to move onto level 2,  hogan's alley.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I had a girlfriend once. That's how I got the scar on my face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
woah man to much skin is showing near her eyes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or you could say she's turning into a Super Saiyan!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her defense, Link directly caused the downfall of Hyrule by stupidly gathering all the spiritual stones into the temple of time, just like what Ganondorf needed to do. Then he disappeared for ten fucking years. When he shows up again, Zelda finds out he's been engaged to the Zora princess.

She has a fucking right to be cold to him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha, the Zelda bit was my favourite. I speak French, so I'll translate for you:

Zelda: "OH YEAH, DO ME HARD, ZELDA!"

Link: "NO! FUCK, MY NAME'S LINK! Zelda's a girl's name, and you're Zelda...you do this all the time; it's annoying..." :(

Zelda: "IF I TELL YOU YOU'RE ZELDA, YOU'RE ZELDA, OKAY?!"  &gt;:(

*SMACK*

Link: ...."Okay...I'm a princess! I'm your princess! SAVE ME! Heeheeheehee!" :3

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I mean she's kidnapped by glowey eye weirdos that have tree branches grow out of their head. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
how do you think it feels to touch a woman?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just fired up this machine today to start a Zelda marathon with my girlfriend. Awesome little machine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Zelda, not link, actually made an awesome guy. So, why couldn't link make an awesome girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Showed mine Portal, she got very confused and gave up no matter how much I wanted to play...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't even think it's first... The other one doesn't seem to move at all. Her head just moves with her eye
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell your roommate I think she's pretty for a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just use Kilik and smack her in the face with my pole.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how the redhead actually stops to look at what just happened to her friend. Just that momentary look of disbelief before her face smacks into the top of a lamp-post.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is no amount of preperation for her inbox. Its gone forever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Step back she's going to do a super hero landing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just stare deep into Link's eyes as you penetrate her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We all wish your girlfriend would do that for us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow that red makes her eyes look so awesome and green!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't Shani point out in Hearts of Stone, that a soldier's adventuring days would've been over, if she hadn't treated his knee?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Im not sure if she has colored contacts or just different lighting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wanted to say Zelda, but it must be tiring being her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can someone photoshop the name under her hand so that she's touching an F?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's more of an argument that Zelda has to be female than that Link has to be male.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe not, but she was laying it on pretty thick with the whole ["Come over Mario, I baked a cake for you"]( schtick. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Link's Awakening she's only mentioned by name, right in the very start when Link confuses Marin for her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that even a guy? The little part of the face that's seen reminds me of Loserfruit (a girl).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this is what it looks like if Zelda were a girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd do that but I think my wife would be pretty pissed if I crashed while she was playing Mario...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does it link to a picture of a woman holding a baby leopard cub?!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We spoon for a while, then she's like, "K get the fuck off of me I'm going to sleep."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a picture of a woman holding like a baby leopard 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like they gave her an automated lobotomy or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Link always comes to Zelda's aid. Without saying a word, he has pledged his sword to her. Ipso facto, it's her sword.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I knew a girl named Kirsten who used to play it. 

First hint to my childhood that girls played games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Put a baby in her. Point and say, top that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on mobile and all I can see is a woman holding a baby leopard.

I love how anti Trump supporters say he'll cause a nuclear war and anti Hillary supporters say she would've caused one.

What I don't love is seeing politics in a gaming subreddit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should I break up and then marry her again? I'm confused.

If a hot guy and a hot girl talk, they must fuck. It is written.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, her assets were much more emphasized back then . . .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't want to vote for trump but if it's between that woman and him.......

Just keep getting her salads and next year she'll dance  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not. I'm not a supporter but she hasn't talked about this in years. It was a major talking point a decade ago. Now it's just more bullshit to harass her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you send her a message on etsy? I can't really speak for her you know? 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she did private parties in costume she could make a killing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"He threatened to kill me in public"

"Why would he want to kill you in public?"

"I think she means: He threatened, in public, to kill her."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are no female soldiers in BF1. There is one Bedouin chick in the campaign, which is historically accurate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus this needs more hot guys. 

Lots of hot girls.

One okay guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell do you mean she has an egg?!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it OK wanting to marry another woman if you're married already?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They weren't when she made this speech back in 2005
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how in the end she has lost all will to move
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She supported Jack Thompson.

This is why if I was American I would never vote for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of reasons Hillary lost. 

She lost because she was unpopular. 

She lost because low turnout. 

She lost because the electoral college. 

She lost because trump promised to bring jobs back to the rust belt. 

She lost because historically it's hard for a party to hold the office for more than 8 years. 

Ultimately it doesn't matter. She lost, but the good thing about democracy is we get to vote again. As Obama said... The sun will come up tomorrow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clinton's popular vote is far ahead of Trump, besides she's not doing the work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While Serana's important, so.

(plus I've always wanted to marry her but you know)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hila is the girl married to Ethan Klein, you're thinking of Halal
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has advocated invading countries like Libya with soldiers.  No one takes her stances on violence seriously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The girl isn't hot at all. This is documentation of a guy giving up in life. Why do people find this to be anything other than sad?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about we have one with Hillary where you take out the emails from her chest 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunately, even winning those wouldn't have won her the election since Trump won PA and FL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd at least try and skullfuck the crazy out of her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she wants it, she can have it, but she can't bring her own.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would say Marry her but it appears you already did
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do. It would be ridiculous to include female soldiers in a WWI game. Just like it would be ridiculous not to include the French in a WWI game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He won because he received more electoral votes based on the states he took. More Americans voted for Clinton and she lost. That is a flawed system that needs to be looked at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can fuck girls your whole life but your mind is only sharp enough to dunk nerds for a few years. /s

Member when marriage was between a man and a woman? Ooohh I member!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or at least she was back in 2005 when she made that speech.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes. Trump is a bigot. His supporters if not bigots them selves, which lets be honest they are, support bigotry be supporting Trump. He is the public face of the private gop meetings. 

Not to say Clinton is any better she's a criminal. An amoral sociopath with one goal in mind sitting in the oval office regardless of how our what happens after. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I'm pretty sure that the far right one in the middle is just her character from Hot Fuzz.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are already war games with male/female characters so I don't think that would've been a thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she did win the vote so it isn't a democracy. It's an oligarchy, accept it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she actually won and the losing side is salty
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't look playful, she looks like a flamingo. Flamingos are not known for being playful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why isn't this getting more upvotes? Because it's not a hot girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Were they ever sued by amy winehouse for using her likeness? She would've won.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only if Hillary "Slav Slayer" Clinton is elected (she won't be).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[I was wondering if she'd get hired for another restoration. Good for her.](

I member

That's a moose nuckle on a hot woman. I never thought I'd see that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Step 1: Be an attractive female.

Step 2: Get really fucking dirty.

Step 3: You did it!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she just want to hand a bunch of votes to Trump? Because this is how you hand a bunch of votes to Trump.

She's just jealous that he's rocking it better than her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sugar for diabetes and video games for a sedentary lifestyle. You know she is secretly trying to kill you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i can't co-op necrodancer for the life of me :( but i think it's because im way better at it than the person im playing it with. not to be a snob.. it's just i have no life and she works all the time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now your going to need another because she isn't gonna give that one up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's really cool! Good work! My girlfriend made me a few one time, some of my favorites were a Majora's Mask and Gengar.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The blood on her looks so carefully applied, needs more random.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is it zooming in on her knees?

I don't get it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And *this*, ladies and gentlemen, is why Exodia is banned at tournaments.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're gonna get her a fucking Porsche Cayenne for her 11th
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is it that no spamerino chick?
Why do people care? If you dont like her, dont watch her. Its easy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Still have her halo one on my wall! So cool
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what you call "excellent defilade fire," ladies and gentlemen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd want her in my wigwam if you know what I'm saying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is link a girl? not into flying airships and wacky stuff like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually never got this meme... ELI5 ? Who is this girl ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guys. If you look very carefully you can see her bum.

Ohhhh, I thought it was just a random little girl.

if she played fooball/soccer shes what id call a "keeper"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
shes nuttier than a fruitcake if you care to look her up

____________________ TOPIC 14 ______________________________

Oh she needs to fuck right off with tht shit. Closeminded bullying is not what will help the problem she is trying to fix.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But it's still a problem if the field is *perceived* as unwelcoming from the outside because women won't attempt to get into the field in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Leave that girl. If you stay, you're in a for a roller coaster of emotions for your future.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Kenny please. At least I don't get beaten up by a girl and then get killed"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So a game that encourages you to go outside and walk around and exercise comes out and this girl decides to sell fucking potato chips?! That tells me a couple things about her. 

1. She doesn't know any alternatives. Why not try selling some healthy options? Options that will actually make you full for longer?

2. Her parents did not and are not raising her right. She is clearly misinformed and going down a very bad path already.

Childhood obesity is a HUGE fucking problem and to just ignore it probably makes you worse in this situation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I mean nobody *needs* games, but I think it will be less than 15 years before he starts to miss them.  And yes, you are right, I can barely believe some of the choices my ex makes.  I mean she's got almost complete kidney failure (a hereditary problem that she had plenty of time to expect) and will probably require a transplant or daily dialysis within a few more years, yet she continues to smoke a pack a day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope, it's not. But the situation could have been avoided in the first place if she hadn't goaded Kenny into flipping out. It was obvious that Kenny had a problem, but maybe they could have tried to resolve the situation some other way than "Hey Clem, watch this, I'm gonna prove that Kenny gets dangerously mad by making him dangerously mad!"

Also, when does Jane commit suicide?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly. Generally speaking women did not fight at all in WW1. If you add in women, its a huge disrespect to the millions of men who gave their lives for their countries.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Indeed. Obviously, the only solution is to kill them, bury their corpses in the woods and become a hermit living on Mt Fuji.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't know shit about abusive relationships. 

Mostly what makes a woman stay with a scumbag like that is fear, insecurity and brainwashing. It's not only physical abuse, It's mental too, and that's the real problem. The wounds may heal but the mental issues takes longer treatment.

The vast majority of cases like this leads to nothing because of the fear the woman has to confront a situation like telling relatives or telling it to the authorities. Most of them are not even aware that they are being abused.

Your comment is completely ignorant.

"...danger to women and children"

The mental gymnastics Jesus

If you have such a problem with it, then don't play games. Everyone gets harassed, everyone is told to drink bleach and get cancer, no doubt you as a female experience more of this, but hell everyone gets this shit.
If you don't like it, then don't play. Or find a group of people to play with.

Snoo is a girl GODDAMNIT! DOES NOBODY GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE RULES ANYMORE?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the consequences of being distracted are greater - i.e she's left tied up...

Who does she think she is, Superman? Cause this is how you become one.

Sometimes people switch things up. You're seeing a snapshot. I agree if she's going out every weekend and he stays at home, it's not looking good. But given his shitty choice of alone-vegging game, I doubt he has much experience at this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tough, but she did break the rule that was clearly posted. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He was using the force to probe into her mind. But turns out she had latent force powers as well. This made the connection between them a two way link revealing their deepest secrets / fears to each other.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used to have trouble with that but after I got my current gf I just ask her what I should make my character look like. It helps keep her interested when I decide to play, me giving her choices over certain things I do in-game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seems fair. I have a deep hatred for Mae that simply killing her cannot quench. I hate her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to play characters who are on some level emotionally vulnerable.
For example I really connected with my Geralt of Rivia due in part to the emotional struggles that he faced, which is one of my favorite aspects of the game.

I also like female protagonists, because that allows for a different dynamic in some ways.

Puts an unfair burden on you? You're both married with the agreement to be with each other, not to dictate what life someone can have, you joiend each other because of love and you get benefits (and sex) from that and possibly kids. Maybe she wants to travel the world as it's her life long dream,  maybe she wants to go back toc ollege to get a graduate degree, maybe she has a serious medical issue, or maybe she gets depressed clinically, perhaps still she's lost her job and it's taking a lot of time in this corporate corrupt environment to get something for her, who knows.

You are MARRIED, you are not together with an adult, you are unified. And in any case she has the sex in her hands, she should in all forms have the ability to influence you more than you're willing to admit or comfortable with.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah, except society doesn't teach men that their value lies in the way they look to the same extent that it does for women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like she is being forced to use the gun and she isn't ready, but she wants to act like she is. Maybe slightly handicapped given her age and the situation
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah, rather badly worded

Anyways, in a better way of saying it, watching you succeed where she constantly fails probably isn't a good idea
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you relay a message please? Tell her I think her work is really fucking good, I just cant justify paying that much for a blanket. Im not Kanye West. Though, I hope she can find an easier route thats more financially fiesable. Even so her work is great to look at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Technically, yeah. I mean they kind of made it work, but it was all because of a MacGuffin. The *only* reason that they needed to free Anakin from slavery using the podrace was because they found the one guy in the entire galaxy that was immune to force persuasion.

Even worse than that, Qui-Gon even demonstrated that there were other alternatives when he influenced the chance cube to make it so that Anakin would be the one freed not his mother. If he was able to influence the world around Watto without him noticing then surely he could have figured out a way to free Anakin (and his mother?!) from slavery without, you know, risking the life of a child in an incredibly deadly race.

Or, perhaps since slavery is a moral wrong as well as being illegal in the Galactic Republic (of which Tatooine was an outlying planet, but still a part) they could have simply seized Anakin (and his mother) and left.

They had plenty of opportunity as Anakin and Mom lived separately from Watto and Qui-Gon and friends are allowed free access to them. It would not have seemed excessive for a Jedi to simply enforce the moral right and free the slaves.

Now some may respond by pointing out that they needed Watto to give them a part for their ship and that *that* was another reason that the pod race was necessary, but there were other solutions to that as well.

First off there is simply the solution of force. Between two Jedi and the Queen's security forces they could have simply taken it. Perhaps this doesn't seem very 'Jedi' like, but doesn't it? If there is one thing that the prequels taught us it is that the Jedi are not above placing the greater good above all else. Moreover, they are on a mission that is essential to the security of the galaxy and Qui-Gon thinks they just found space Jesus in the form of Anakin (turns out he might not have been right, but he thought he was) so a little force doesn't seem that out of the question.

But even if Qui-Gon would have been unwilling to do that there were still other solutions:

He could have threatened to turn Watto in to the Galactic authorities for slavery (which again it is made clear is illegal). Something along the lines of, "you are giving us the part, the only question is if you will be coming with us to face slavery charges, give it to us peacefully and we'll let you stay here. Make us take it from you and you'll be coming with us and tried for slaving". The Jedi are basically a Galactic police force after all. I mean they more or less say that when Mace Windu says that they *aren't* an army but are just a peace keeping force. Here are two Jedi that are witnessing not only a crime, but a human rights violation. They should probably do something about it.

Or, they are flying the Queen's ship. I know they left in a hurry, but presumably it was pre-stocked with goods. Just look at her ridiculous wardrobe. Surely there was *something* on that ship worth bartering with.

Or they could have combined some of these. Perhaps they use the force to make the Queen's wardrobe look more valuable than it is to trade it for the ship part and Anakin and then also sneak his mother out at night.

All that to say as /u/radicalation put it, the pod racing scene was awesome, but why was it necessary? Pretty much only so that we could see an awesome pod racing scene. There were so many other, better, and safer options that they could have pursued.

Bull... They were going to off her to see if there was a chance that it might do some good... they didn't have the resources to make it happen.

For starters, it means that we live within the limitations of the simulation. 

This could mean any number of things. It could mean we have a slower speed of light, or that technologies which are possible outside the simulation aren't possible inside. What if quick travel between stars isn't as far fetched as it sounds, it's just that the physical laws of our simulation don't allow for it? What if our atoms are coarser than 'real' atoms, hence limiting our ability to make technologies such as nanomachines and microprocessors past a certain scale?

Those kinds of things would definitely limit the scope of our civilization compared to what a 'real' one would be capable of achieving in their reality.


The most horrifying thing about being inside a simulation is that THERE IS A GOD. That's right, somebody, some man, woman, or something in between, or maybe even a whole team of them, has complete and total control over every aspect of our reality. I have no reason to believe they aren't a billion times smarter and wiser than your average human being, but I can sure as hell tell you one thing, *I would never want someone with the mind of man as I know it to be in control of reality*. That's a BAD combination.

And here's a thought... What if our universe HAS a purpose?

Great! Right? Wrong.

What happens when that purpose is fulfilled? How do we have any way of even knowing what that purpose is? The most arbitrary action could spell the end of our universe if it sates the intellectual curiosities of whoever runs the show. Maybe the whole point is to watch the first child born in 2045 pick their nose, and then it just shuts down? I mean, who knows if this simulation is even unique, they could have a thousand simulations running simultaneously just for the purpose of simulating random climax events and then ending all of history and starting new with a new scenario.

The bottom line is that it's just plain terrifying to think of intelligence as we know it having any manner of control over a whole universe, because intelligence as we know it can have any number of arbitrary reasons to do  whatever it is it decides to do. The nice thing about our universe, if it is real, is that based on everything we've observed we can still predict what's going to happen, and even when. If intelligence of any kind were to have influence, who knows how it could echo throughout the universe. The most cursory change could throw off all of our knowledge and predictive models leaving us in the dark.  
  
**edit: tl;dr intelligence having control over reality is a bad**

If you play more like a renegade with her feelings, she will duck your brains out and then never really open up to you. It doesn't really develop into a relationship either.

The problem is that he-man picture is also heavily used by people like /u/xTRYPTAMINEx who don't want to help men, but just shut down and conversation about women.

If you want to help men, bring up the mens topics on their own, don't raise them as a counterpoint to women's issues. We need to fix all of it, but if the issues are different, there's no point in trying to tackle them simultaneously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its a responsive in the nature of the community that loved her. Would you rather that no one cared?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope she proves everyone wrong and it detonates and causes a portal rift to open into another dimension and then we successfully meet aliens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, lots of people backed out  because they were quite controlling over their content creators and wanted a significant share of their earnings while retaining copyright for other people's content. Also the CEO allegedly once raped a female youtuber.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think that's why people voted for her. Nobody really liked her, it was more about let's avoid putting a narcissistic man child in a really important position. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm giving the benefit of the doubt and assuming it's a narrative reason. What's one of the most common devices to take down your boss? Ally with the group trying to bring them down and work as an informant/agent. You were likely disarmed by the guards as a requirement to meet her, then the guard (your ally) pretends to threaten you. That's their plan to get you re-armed without getting him killed in the process. 

This is all just guesswork but it makes a lot more sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  she could theoretically remove the chance of impregnation if she activated her ability quickly enough; a 'post-nut' defence mechanism,

The female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I follow this girl and her sister on deviantart.  I'm pretty sure they know a lot of different folk with individual talents, and I believe they had the sword specially made by a blacksmith friend of theirs.  They go by the name [love-squad](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Based off of my import Saturn she got me recently.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
even though this is stupid as fuck she has good presentation skills
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I get that you're playing devil's advocate, but what you're advocating for is a slippery slope of privilege and oppression bullshit where everyone is trying to prove what a fucking victim they are.

There is plenty of bad shit that is worse for men than it is for women, but nobody gives a fuck because men are apparently just supposed to deal with their problems like adults.  Well so should women.  In fact all adult humans should deal with their problems like adult humans; imagine that.

Also it's up to individual people to separate their fantasy from their reality.  If someone is really driven to the types of behaviour you suggest because of exposure to some tits in a video game, then there are bigger issues at play.

He gets him all the secret developer cheats that make the girl characters clothes fall off, but they only work for him.  You have to have a special console.

I have bunch of female friends. And I'd hit every single one, I maybe aren't actively looking for it but given the chance I wouldn't back down.

It's worth noting that Cortana chose Noble 6 before she chose Chief.

As far as the lore goes Noble 6 was better, faster and more skilled. What he didn't have was Chief's luck. After Noble 6's death Cortana opted for the luckiest rather than the best.

It's also worth noting that many other Spartans were demonstrably better or more skilled than Chief too. He was however a great leader, and an incredibly lucky soldier making it through situations time and again that he absolutely should not have.

____________________ TOPIC 15 ______________________________

Because she mentioned she dislikes her breasts when compared to another woman. Right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you read the books? I quite like her. I mean, Geralt is my favorite fictional character. The whole series is really about Ciri. And Geralts adventures trying to find her. Kinda like Witcher 3!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her Yen ones and that girl from got is really good. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cuteness overload. Maybe she wasn't as confused by the teaser as I was!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But people are weenies and there is a girl so they might get a boner. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The smiling girl was the only redeeming thing in this 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never played witcher, played witcher 2, and will never stop playing wit her 3.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All I can see when I look at her is the fingers... I cannot un-see them.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's weird. No one ever really talks about this game, just the girl from it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree.....  Time to let her go. Is that mine sweeper?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can see it too.  Geralt has women throwing themselves at him all the time.  It's no surprise that he'd show interest in the one who rejects his advances.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not surprised seeing Gerald of Riva with yet another woman. Triss/Yen sure are forgiving... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's why many girls think Paris and Venice are romantic when actually they are just overpriced holes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; but who really cares about how she acts with Ciri?

geralt?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That annoyed me so much I chose to kill her off on Vermire from then on because I didn't want her to think I wanted her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a terrible idea though, the baddies could just tune in and see where she is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish I was a cute girl so I could wear them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know. I understand that in the books Yen and G are very close but only having played W3 it seems like she's blatantly using him... then again just about every other character in the game is too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And that makes sense, guys get aroused, etc by seeing while girls do that by what they read, hear, etc. So games as a visual art will always be "biased" towards men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yen is love, yen is life. Geralts awkward compliments around her are the best.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what she wants you to think. Actually her character in W3 is a bit too much of a Pollyanna, but in the books and the Witcher 1 and 2 she's totally a Femme Fatale.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ciri ~~C~~ C~~i~~iri

Cir~~i~~

Ciril~~l~~la

Cir~~i~~lla

Fiona

Ciri Cirilla 

Ele~~n~~ Ria~~n~~nnon

Elen Ria~~n~~nnon

Elen Riannon

It's Ciri (Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon) attempting to write her own name, and not having very much luck. Glagolitic script is quite difficult to write with, even if you just substitute English letters for the Glagolitic script like CDPR have done. Presumably they have a different alphabet in Skellige and Cintra. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I changed the L4D witch sounds to her voice. Made coming back to the game after a year both confusing and hilarious.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I just killed her and I agree, I fucking lost it when I went into the trapdoor as Dandelion and then seeing Geralt's reaction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's my favorite line from the books. Magnificent writing she does.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, just Ciri describing a world she hid from the hunt, which is pretty identical to Cyberpunk 2077's world. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does that girl look so derpy in the screenshots. I'll stick with Witcher 3s Triss/Yen kthx. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to see her as Arkum Harley Quinn. Her facial expressions are on point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just need more GLaDOS. Every line from her is great. Makes me smile every time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she is, in ME3 :P and that goodbye at the end is my favorite ;_;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How the hell do you know she's cute? Can't see shit maan

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whenever I see her I read the text in her dopey voice. Watch indigo league if you don't know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For some reason I feel like this was written in the women's restroom
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish she had "Please do the needful" in her script somewhere. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I read this as "This guy made a game to prolapse to his girlfirend." I don't even know why I read it like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not saying she doesn't have a cute face but I would like to see her with the mask on... is that weird?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is a pro at catching her, terrible at keeping her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on my second play through, so far I've been a dick to Yen and had sex with Keira then killed her, I don't know what I am doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The female voice actor is way better, I think. The male voice is boring as fuck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't know who the fuck she was... I just thought she looks like Geralt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How lucky can one guy be? I kissed her and she kissed me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good thing she never watched you play to see what you were actually doing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean... you could game for *fewer* than 8 hours at a time. You could go for a walk! Or read a book! Or meet a girl!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aisha Tyler, and yes she did it on her own and the article doesn't make it seem like they were overall happy about it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lets dispense with this fiction that she doesn't know what she's doing.  She knows exactly what shes doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping I wasn't the only one really annoyed by her voice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This would explain why the voice acting in Bethesda's games can be... uninspiring. Imagine what a difference it would make if a voice actor could really get into a role by knowing a character and his/her motivations. This would be better for the games industry imho.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the only one I didn't bang because I screwed up the conversation the first time I met her. I only had one play-through of ME3
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was confused.  
By the time you meet her again she is back to her normal personality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish dead on included any bit of her silly character or facial expressions

You don't know how that bovine identifies! And though you didn't say it, the implication that all females are cows triggers me.

Even as a big AMD fangirl i cant recommend buying an amd cpu right now. If its not urgent, wait for the newer ones.

They'll have two ps4 when she'll be back with him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she just slashed his jaw off, not punched.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really like the new Lara and her look. I also prefer her over the more high-res version of the old one (before the reboot). I think she looks prettier this way and also a lot more believable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Supposedly there is an HD remaster coming for PC/XO/PS4. /r/PS4 has been fangirling pretty hard. Their last open world game wasnt exactly great so they need a replavement.

I got them from HillsHeels on Etsy. The owner of the shop is super easy to work with and talk to, and she can do pretty much any design it seems.

You can literally see her eyebrows rise just a little bit out of fear.

I just wish zarya was better. She is by far my favourite character. But I never do well as her because she just feels so weak, especially compared to Rhein. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lara Croft?  I thought she was a zombie from the walking dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

First 4 Laras I'm with you. But her incarnations since the ps2 are not worth playing imo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess. But still as pointed out *she* is younger in the new series than in the old ones.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not how armour or physics works... The main reason is there really wasn't many armoured female Knights trotting around in medieval times.

What should we call this game about a lady who raid tombs?
Tomb raider.
What about the sequels?
Tomb raider.
But we...
TOMB. RAIDER.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Designed by a woman, mind you. In the way Conan was designed by a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I liked Peach best for her hover over toads strength. You still have Gyromite and R.O.B.?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a woman I'm a mix of Pam and Cheryl... like Pam with a choking fetish and tungsten knitting needles...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm all for a female protagonist, but she should look more like a female bodybuilder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is this being downvoted? The tomb raider game in 2013 was a reboot,she's literally younger in this and Rise of the tomb Raider than the original games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
On closer inspection I think he/she has fooled us all. I've dismantled a PS4 controller before and they could easily put that back together.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would have said tomb raider. Way better game and she's soooo hot hehe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man final fantasy is one of my favourite game series ever but my gf of 8 years thinks it's boring :-( she just wants me to play hitman or rainbow six instead of buy this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And if you [e621 Lara Croft]( shit gets truly outrageous.

That's beyond NSFW, by the way. Incognito is probably mandatory. There's no reasonable explanation you could give.

But she's certainly naked.

Me vs the guy she tells me not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
MineCraft on any platform is great, my girlfriend and I have just started playing it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, again, most male characters in the medium are not designed with real women sexualizing them like women in the medium typically are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just want to point out your straw man argument there. Comparing two same generation consoles is not the same as comparing two random computers. New computers have a tremendous range. Maybe two top of the line computers released at the same time, but certainly not "computers are inherently the same.". That wasn't what he/she said at all.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More like, "that strong female lead character we tried to butcher in Other M?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I let my ex set up the profile, and I still play with her username today which is ten years later. Still bothers me. I got my ps3 at launch, like that big 40gb version with only 2 usb connections.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually both. The old tomb raider games croft was a badass already.  In these games she isn't. She's no slouch, but she's much more vulnerable,  so it's easier to get tied into the game. The puzzles are great as well, albeit a bit difficult at times. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will never forget when FF X2 came out Game Informer had a bit called final fatassy where all three girls were extremely overweight.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
May is the female protagonist of RSE, not Leaf. This is Leaf.

We would have gotten along, [I was the girl version of this picture](

That's exactly why she never drives. Where would we be without our car crashes?

Little Big Planet series is great if you both haven't played. Let her choose the games from steam that look interesting. I guess you're a gamer, so have patience with her and let her do some of the harder parts. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As she is, she looks more like the Smiling Titan than Lara Croft.

You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about

You vs me vs the guy she tells u not to worry about.

____________________ TOPIC 17 ______________________________

The problem with that is he can turn it around on her. She would need another angle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is posting a sexualized version of tracer really related to a topic of a non sexualized pose getting removed. If anything this just shows that people like her arse and are pissed that it got removed because they can't wank off to her arse pose. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did the SJWs really say that though? Unless I'm mistaken the "complaint" was simply that they didn't think it fit her character and that plenty of other characters made sexy poses but it was fine for them, and the devs seemed to agree 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That second response is just PR bullshit and you know it. Even IF they believed that this pose doesnt fit her, there is no need to remove it for the people who DO like it.

Add more poses that you think fit her more? Sure, go for it! But dont remove the ones already there because someone on the forum complained about their kid that shouldn't even be playing the game in the first place might actually see her butt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
....or, it could be a guy playing a female character. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think I fit into any of these categories. I've always just played as a female character without even thinking about it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The whole "butts of Overwatch" thing is getting pretty tired out. Yes Overwatch has female characters, yes they have butts. Move along.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha no. Creators can pursue whatever-the-fuck artistic vision that they want. Also, this line of thinking seems to assume attractive/shapely women don't exist in real life.

&gt; Dead or Alive is pretty sexist

No it isn't. It would be sexist if all the female fighters were inherently worse or if someone in the game, at some point, said "women suck." Making the girls sexually appealing is not inherently sexist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's the problem with this pic exactly that labels her as an *instawhore*?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"There's no way a woman would demean herself like that, by doing such a raunchy pose!" Said all the idiots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tifa can do whatever she wants to it. I will not complain.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The issue isn't that she's attractive or that her outfit is potentially sexual, they're not removing her skin tight outfit. She'll still have the same body type, that's not what this is about 

It's not as simple as "looking over her shoulder". Her hips were spread out and she was angled to draw viewer's eyes to her ass. When you look at Hanzo you see the whole character and with Tracer's pose your eyes are drawn straight to her ass, if you follow the perspective that's just where eyes are drawn. And even if Hanzo was sexualized that doesn't mean that Tracer has to be. They want to achieve something else with the character and that's okay. 

I don't know much about the character McCree, but if the character is designed to not have a sexual aspect and the pose does have a focus on sex then maybe it should be removed. However, there are plenty of sexualized characters in the game no one has any problem with. The issue isn't that there are sexualized women, or that men aren't sexualized, or a character like Tracer couldn't conceivably be sexual. The issue is simply that's not what the point of the character is and the pose diluted what they wanted to achieve with her. They decided to change the pose to something else. What is the problem with that? It seems odd to me that this one pose for this one character is so important to anyone. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;the pose but it just doesn't fit Tracer's character.

The pose is just her standing. How does that not fit someone's character? What kind of "character" is one that doesn't include standing? Other than somebody in a wheelchair.

This does not sexualize him though. Please watch Serkesian's video about butt coverage, even though you disagrees with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she's a fictional character, that's why. Why should devs be beholden to how certain people see a character, and not others? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
sex is not defined by physical appearance/expression, though. it's defined by genetics.

and please answer my question: who defined what a female or male brain looks like in the first place?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't you get the memo? Every woman in every game has to be sexualized now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except that the crux of the suggestion, which Kaplan agreed with, wasn't that it was sexy: it was that it didn't seem to fit her character in general. The guy fumbled it a bit by mentioning sex appeal and his daughter, but the crux of it remains: he didn't feel it fit Tracer. That was fucking it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was me replying to *that* comment. But the wider discussion is about how women can/should be portrayed in media - and I'm on the side of "sexy poses are not damaging". 

&gt;Foremost, the creator of this character actually agreed that it doesn't fit her character.

That's what he said, but that's also in direct contrast to what he said *earlier*. Which one do you take as the truth? It shouldn't have been an issue anyway - one person complaining about something as mundane as a *pose* shouldn't have gotten any traction and certainly not a literally game-changing one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, I thought "real women don't exist that look like game characters"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That first pose is no longer Blizzard sanctioned, please let her know she must stop using it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he complained that a sexual pose doesn't fit her character's personality, NOT that the pose was sexual. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that just means you're going to ***gloss over*** what you're really doing and not call it by its name: 

* ***defining the 'right way' of depicting women*** 

:shrugs: 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy who made the original post did mention Widow, they didn't have a problem with them because it was suited to the character. The problem they had with the original Tracer pose was that it was sexualised in a way which didn't fit with her character. Like the new pose might still have her ass in it but the posing is more consistent with her personality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fuck? Alot of people want female characters? I always play one in place of my girlfriend and she always plays a male in place of me. Fucking great like on Divinity Original Sin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she had no real character. Overwatch is not a game with a real narrative
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I can see where you're comming from, and agree completely, there's a Little bit of backstory to this.

Tracer is a hero of the upcoming Blizzard game Overwatch. An user made a post saying he found one of her victory poses to sexualize her, and the game director said he would remove it.

However that created a lot of controversy in the overwatch community because that pose is shared by a lot of characters ( ) and well a lot of senseless drama.

So in this other Blizzard Game, Heroes of the Storm, where Blizzard characters are present and battle each other, they announced Tracer as a playable character at the Spring Championship, and the cosplayer they hired for the event decided to do the pose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your argument can just as easily be applied to having her not show off her ass as well, though.

So if Blizzard decided they don't want Tracer showing off her ass, then that decision should be respected just as well!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I'm glad you know the character better than the people who created her and agreed the pose didn't fit her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; suits her character more.

Four other characters use this pose. So are they all being changed also because they don't fit the "personality" of the video game character?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not into that kind of thing. But I think she is the cutest of the characters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then we got to see her ass as she used an emote, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I asked another friend who knows him better than me and she said to say like 7
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm just wondering why they had her in that pose to begin with? Why that pose specifically? How were they *not* trying to sexualize her? And if they weren't..isn't it worse that they couldn't recognize it? It's now so commonplace to have a woman in that sexual pose that it's not even sexual anymore...it's expected?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I enjoy my butts in gaming I don't want feminists completely removing nice butts from gaming because there demeaning to woman right sure 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's just idiotic. This isn't a real person. This isn't sexualizing a little girl or a family member.

This is a fictional character, it hurts nothing and no one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the "Too sexual, doesn't match her character, must be removed, offensive pose
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i would shove my tongue way up in links ass... oh its a girl?.. whatever would still put my tongue in that ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It looks like she's getting it in the ass for the first time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is so bitchin' man! Your woman is talented. She's a fine artist. 

This totally looks like some character from Rick &amp; Morty. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The obvious ones are people getting upset that women exist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The butt pose controversy was because Tracer's butt pose was out of character. Widowmaker had a pose that was even more, "Hey, look at this butt" and nobody said anything about it because she's the femme fatale character archetype. Given her characterization, there was no real reason for that pose to exist on Tracer. It was replaced with a pose that resembled an oldschool pinup that still featured her butt, but was more in character.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where is the SJW calling this sexist because girls can play video games too?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
only a sexy girl could get away with saying something so overly simplified. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As long as there's no sexy women in video games that is, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
this is one of the dumbest things i've seen in a good long time. if the problem was feminists against sexualizing characters it would have been directed toward all the female characters but it wasn't and it isn't. someone called out blizzard for a lazy design choice and blizzard agreed. you wanna see ass you don't even need to turn off overwatch, just play widowmaker. get the fuck over it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


honestly the pose almost does more for her chest than her butt
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;My problem came from the argument that she cant be sexy because she is funny.

No one made that argument...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the argument that they're making is that men being beef-cakes isn't a problem because men WANT to be beef-cakes in real life. It's an aspirational thing to be able to be one in a video game. The problem feminists have with women in games is that women are little more than cum-dumpsters for men to high-five over at the end. 

*Disclaimer. I'm not on either side of this 'debate' I'm just explaining the argument. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Blizzard didn't remove it because people are complaining, it's because that pose looks like shit on her

&gt; I get the joke, but the whole "it's the responsibility of a woman's male relatives to safeguard her virginity" thing is really patronizing and gross.

I don't think this particular joke was in the context of *that*

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why people who hate her are phony. All you did was say "Hey I actually worked with her and she was actually really nice" and at least 3 people said FUCK YOU DOWNVOTE!!

I had a post taken down from mildly interesting once. It was a picture I took in a Burlington store where one of the big decorative pictures on the wall was the same picture as good girl Gina. They took it off because one rule is "no memes"  it wasn't a literal meme, just related to one.

Me too, OP doesn't know what he/she is talking about.

My girlfriend would appreciate this post more than you could ever know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Just because there is a woman in the picture does not make this NSFW

The logic is right, but the post is not.

NSFW =/= nudity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how everyone wants to comment how smart he/she is without openly bragging. Theres a smartass in every single one of us.

I tried to get her to play some simpler games on the internet but she wasn't into it the same way.

What's next, any photo of a woman is NSFW?

Had to come to the comments to see if that was a girl.

I thought that I had seen here before on this sub. Here is what I saw her in:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't you think it's interesting that people had to create subs to even find such post? I never wrote it never happens I only stated that I've never seen these kind of women hating post myself. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you critizising video game journalists? Why do you hate women?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should be obvious. He/she is replying to a post that says "18+ album uncensored."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife would upvote this comment if she cared about Reddit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, look at OP's profile. All they do is post pictures of sexy women for karma.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Here]( is the link for the thread where she originally posted it with pictures of her making it.

I just think you're all missing the point of the post? Guy does nice thing; girl has nice reaction?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hah, was she doing shitty on purpose?  Like was this a joke
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should thank her by doing the dishes for once.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you didn't bring the feathers back, "vaginas" was her last word in the game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP want's the internet to say, they'd fuck his girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks for explaining. Now I feel like she was deliberately positioned like that just so people can do this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I showed my wife this jokingly and laughing and she immediately ordered it from Amazon.

You don't have to be a stormtrooper to miss her, I've just seen the front page

That's outrageous! What do you think, guys? Should we kill her?

^^/s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean, did she have 'avid listeners' before that song?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a lucky guy. If my woman played dark souls with me, I would never not be erect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That actually was news to me. I watch a 2 year old and she pretty much has it down. I guess accidents happen though
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend doesn't want the new Zelda game because she thinks it looks too much like Dark Souls. I think she is crazy because it doesn't look enough like Dark Souls

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It did look like she was going for a swing at him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, Calcifer. That's what you say to all the pretty ladies. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was watching the way I did it and yes, would you believe, she was blowing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is anyone in her homeroom class? Can you ask her if she wants to be my girlfriend yes/no/maybe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, she knows it's a multipass. Anyway, we're in love.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Almost like she should be part of the "In the Dark" Brotherhood....ba dum psshhhhh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never said it wasn't a girl, just used "guys" without thinking
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Besides singing it, she didn't really have much to with making the song.

____________________ TOPIC 20 ______________________________

Well, I'm sure the "average" part is subjective, you may not find yourself that attractive

But your girlfriend probably does
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's because he's going to backdoor her when she does not expect it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
too bad she's kinda ugly, but at least got the booty...so i guess congrats 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And did they butcher her name and call her "Laura" instead?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aww someone took the attention away from her. Attention seeking brat. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know it was not the spoons what draw you to her thighs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So... /r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG?

But no, I did honestly think her attention to detail was really good.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women will come up with names for all of them

Women: "Cerulean Grey", "Butterscotch Grey", "Spring Grey"

Men: "Grey", "Grey", "Dark Grey"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he was a pretty girl this would be considered attention-whoring. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah Nicki Minaj is quite the Puritan in her music videos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her name is Tara Babcock and she has a twitch stream and youtube channel. 

In all honestly she's pretty intelligent and keeps it real in her youtube videos (like her tutorial on lighting tips for a stream)

But yes, also boobs. Hooray!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it is called hitman and not hitwoman so wot does he expect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will if she keeps giving me dirty looks :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now she can easily stream all of her favorite obnoxious minecraft youtubers! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost as if women can be beautiful or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah I was just joking.  I was just saying that's what she pretty much did instead of doing something smart with it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who is this? A famous cosplayer? Never seen her before. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even see her adams apple until I looked at it again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some people just won't admit they get turned on by animation. I know tons of guys who make it a point to call out people who find "fake" girls attractive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bah, you know he is just faking interest in video games to get her attention, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she was obviously hired by someone to dress like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because a chick dresses as a video game character that happens to be skimpy, doesn't mean she is some attention whore. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
only le witcheroo threesome can have females that match this pure quality
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahahaha! Only an attention harlot would be mad about that, but come on, we are talking about beautiful women who dress up like video game characters, so who's surprised?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Obsession with women of the WWE? Now youre just making things up. I have no time for blatant liars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it's drawn at school, I expect you to receive a call notifying you of her expulsion. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No I think okay video games women obvious course yes.  

It just parts of me thinks this more attention seek than game love, yes?  Confuse as to who objectify who and who dress up game for.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is crappy. You will be better off, and she didn't deserve your time. Game on.

You'll find a good player 2 eventually.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, saying a girl has double D's could be a compliment too, but if she's sporting A cups, then it's still not true.  You just wanted to use that gif.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not only is the work she did amazing but that collection of games is also amazing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was a little anti climactic. I was expecting you to throw her off the ledge..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would be great if she was like Catalina in GTA3/SA. Just a crazy psychopath like the rest of the protagonists.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's got the bunny ears. She's ready for her own Twitch channel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I asked her which is her favorite. she said all of them! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, I'm telling you I think she's attractive.   That would make me the pedophile in your world.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then she gets that one and he's back to the average
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend is getting into gaming and she is playing this right now. She loves the beauty of the game the most.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Set her up a twitch! Then put donations into a college fund!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played a girl bunny?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This kind of love is my favorite. She loves that it was put up by you, and it has meaning to you, so it had meaning to her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly, men only ever take women out to get their 'balls on their jigglies...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it me or are the girls that dress up for these conventions always hot.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah man she's just trying to get back from [Davy Jones' Locker](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Play Mercy because girl and get views because girl

&gt;Play other characters as guy but get no views because average skill

FTFY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like that inflating woman ball game that used to be in arcades.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gravis/Breitbart has her up +4
Fox has her up +7
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not good enough, I want to see her use Morph Ball 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do girls like this even play videogames or do they just want attention?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is one of many criticisms. There's no *one* thing that she's done which deserves the most criticism.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is great. Now, how many women on twitch will make this ?

____________________ TOPIC 21 ______________________________

My girlfriend is the same way...she spend 2 hours creating a character on DkS1 only to never make it out of the undead asylum...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's why I have a mutt. Healthy, will live forever, and she was free. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My friend is still running a 6850 and she even played TW3 on it. It wasn't even that great of a card in its time, which was what, 2010-2011?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or sell them for what they're worth and tell her you got 60$. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got my first bj 15 years ago today. Her name was K**** and her tits were massive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Took my lady shopping in seattle for xmas. 

Wanna spend 100$ on eyelash crap from sefora? Merry Christmas 
50$ nordstrom scarf?screw it 
Wouldnt even go in there. It's like tjmax thought it was a boutique 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you probably don't have a girlfriend because you use xD unironically
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What made me ask is that my girlfriend bought me a DBZ hoodie a while ago and the picture of Goku that was on the front faded after about a couple months. Made me a little sad.

Maybe this technique will give me more time with my next DBZ hoodie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she has only used it once, wasn't good at any of the games, and I already own a working NES with over 60 games  (almosy all are in the Classic).

And we're trying to buy a house so an extra $150 instead of something we don't use would be great. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, it is, they've said that already. 

And it runs all the games she plays just fine. She's 10, she's not going to be doing 3D modeling. It'd be stupid to spend money on new parts for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that "someone" was being a dick and they decided that he or she will get a cheap sweaters instead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well if one part of the couple makes more money than the other then you almost need to unless you plan on making every bill a hassle.  Let's say the girl makes 100k a year and the guy makes 30k.  Well when they decide to buy a nice home that could cost thousands of dollars in bills the guy is either really going to struggle or they are going to have to find a way to say "ok this month you pay this much and I pay this much". Or you could just combine your money and write one check. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
100% you will play as the girl all the time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely a keeper, but how did she work on it without you noticing it? ü§î
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks about 20 in the new trailer and she looked about 12 or 13 in the first game 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So do you go into stores and tell them you love jesus and how he's gon save you and sell people muffins and then give that money to your pastor who probably turns around and buys little girls so he can trade them for little boys?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're gerudo. They live in a sweltering desert and mostly only with other women. Off topic time of the month must be hell. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
of course it's a given. pretty girl in tank top and shorts, 500 upvotes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For once it is worth a like because she is skilled!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
dude i would pay your wife some good money if she ever made me one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The looks were item 2. The girl is item 1.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My grandma, like many grandmas, has to be able to run every toolbar known to man in her browser.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, he spent about half his net worth in one big surge. I think he wanted to save up another 30-40 billion to donate all at one.

Or Melinda decided to ease up and only make him donate a couple billion each time before she would put out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you have a girlfriend or are married?   If so, what does she think of your collection. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she bring it down to the basement for you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My money is on its his mom pretending to be Dylan cause she wants to buy him a game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Armenia was pretty lucky it was a Georgian woman, not an Azerbaijani woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you don't understand how litigation works.

It costs you money- a lot of it- to retain an attorney. Just the retainer is at very least $1,000. Then you are paying him or her several hundred dollars an hour for their time, or their paralegal about half that for theirs. Then there's filing fees, etc.

Say you want to go pro se. Be ready to spend hours reading up on what paperwork you need to file with whom and when. Filing fees still apply, budget for about $350 to file initial paperwork. Another hundred to two hundred to have the other party served.

Let us know how your lawsuit comes out. TLDR: Suing somebody doesn't mean "they were wrong so they send me free money while I sit here."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a girlfriend to spend money on I'm not a single 25 year old with too much disposable income.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl doesn't need to be any closer to food. All ~~she~~ it needs are a ton more chromosomes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  she did not receive any of the gold

topkek
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These girls wont even be friends in a couple years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She just bought about 6 months of you being oblivious to her fucking another dude
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea idk. I mean I don't want my wife to have less just because she makes less than me. We have kids, so it's a moot point now, but once they grow up I don't see why I would penalize her for making less money by saying "well I earned more". Idk, it just sounds like a roommate arrangement to me, rather than joint marital finances. I would feel like crap having tons of money and doing whatever I wanted while my wife barely had any spending money.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Their "example" was set almost a decade ago when they sued the owner of WoWScape for something like $80,000,000 and won. 

The owner ran away to Costa Rica with the $3,000,000 she made from WoWScape.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but then you spend all your gold on the girlfriend badge and some asshole hacker comes in and takes the badge and half your gold with him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe she's just a gold digger and found the right guy... you never know üòì
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless he/she earns 5$ a month he/she can get both
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend and I have about 200 hours in boi :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Something something I used to spend 10 hours hacking the game so she was shirtless /circlejerk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well those are 9 months she'll never get back....9 months closer to the grave.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D.Va is also 15 or something, so there's that

Edit: Misremembered the story, she was 16 when she was drafted, and is 19 now. Carry on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you have to be a very, very lucky man. with a very lucky girlfriend(s)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A friend of mine in college paid for her games by just going to party's and collecting everyone's beer caps. 

She basically got paid to party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well in the first game she turned out to be married. So...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ummmm she'll be fine but let her rest until she has a pulse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're spring loaded so she can fire them into the philtrums of her enemies
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you can get money for your daughter out of it great. If not what a waste of time for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This chick is gonna be SO busy when there's like 2,000,000 people playing the game. How will she keep up?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is a free... a free.. she is a free citizen of the world!

____________________ TOPIC 22 ______________________________

Not many, just one. ;)

She deserved it for telling her dream to gamers. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Table top gamers who are socially awkward and difficult to talk to?! Inconceivable! lol I jest, I have some friends who TT, 40k, Shadowrun, D&amp;D games. They're cool, so long as you don't have girls around. My friends are total nerds, but they're great guys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol it is perfectly fine, my friend! In fact, it even made my day! :D Thanks for making a sad girl happy! :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do it dude. She'll have the time of her old life
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So fucking accurate. I am totally one of the dudes asking where manriks wife is, I had no fucking idea where to find her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping she turned into a radioactive zombie or something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so is she a gamer or does she just tolerate your gaming?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At first I didn't know if it was her or not, lol. She looks so different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like shooter games I always have since I was 7. I am a girl. This is some bull  honkey shut it IOS
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, I would like to see her try it on now...... This is exactly what it's like lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
assholes like sarkesian only care about the oversexzulaization of women. not men.

men are not equal....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pokeman? Harry Potter? I hope you get a girlfriend some day, fella, but I'm sure as hell not holding my breath. LOL!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
plus it doesn't look like she made a big deal out of it, she just got mad behind his back, so who cares. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; It's cool because women can be just as cool but we don't see that very much.

So, diversity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dump her now. Once a liar, always a liar.

:P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah fuck you for liking video games! How dare you insult the intelligence this niche audience by trying to insinuate that a *girl* plays video games. Gah, some people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love awkward zombie's humour she's great I especially loved her smash bro's ones lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she do anal? I only want to watch if she gets her asshole demolished.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still can't stop thinking that her name sounds like a Klingon insult.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I wanted my comeback I'd wipe it off her chin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cool but take her to a Vet aswell get her chipped and all that stuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's so much fun. I love pissing people off with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hate to break your bubble...Dickgirls and Futanari aren't the same..

sad pathetic morons do u think she really gives a shit about a bunch of nerds fapping to her and pretending to give a shit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who say's I'm mad? In fact, you're the one starting to lob personal insults for some reason. I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings and made you aware that your imaginary internet girlfriend is a phony who has a fake online persona so that sad pathetic people like you think that she's an "OMG gamer girlz lol" but she doesn't give one iota of a shit about you or games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never hated her but she never wowed me in anything BUT alien, so maybe i'll try this 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude has no reflex. So I'm hoping she's gobbling down your knob and not neglecting the snowballs.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's really fucking cool, should have named her "A girl"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she the one who needs to bleach her asshole?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well if you think about it, she could enjoy herself again and again, less work for you ;) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gamer guys these days are so lucky.  In my day gamer girls were so rare.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have like 15ish videos and no one ever watches them. I still upload and record because it's fun in itself. I have a friend who does the same and no one really watches her stuff either. It's just for fun, it adds another layer to the entertainment we get from video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your going to turn her into a twitch gamer beggar
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bae'Va best waifu, but seriously. She's super fun to play and really hard to kill, hope they keep her like this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As someone who is going on year 9 with my girl, that was my first thought lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[This is his wife.]( His wife is likely a lovely woman, but she is not exactly a supermodel...I am an asshole.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, you're that guy.  Who cares?  My game says Aeris.  It's what I grew up on.  I'll stick with it.  If it's Aerith in the remake, then so be it, she'll go by Aerith.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha can you imagine the slew of people defending their online girlfriends though? That or "i only play for the acheivements bro"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Yeah, that's my wife.

fucking nice dude! Is she single?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hey I'm going to pretend to be mad in this video It'll be funny"

"oh no! People think i'm actually mad! I never thought that would happen!" 

What did you think she expected? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend gets mad that I don't have enough time for video games. She asked me to call out of work the other day to play Uncharted!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should go find a carpenter and tell him or her they garner no respect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True, but LAUREL'S BACK so it's all okay. Then again I'm biased, cause I may or may not share a name with her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a difference between dudes drawing dudes for hetro dudes to look at, and dudes drawing women for hetro dudes to look at. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, people are online for that... and the occasional girl or friend comes over to play on your other computer with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I boycott women in hopes that they'll *become* good men.

*I like men.*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even Bonnie stung a bit...I was nice to her even when she fucked us over and got the group captured. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would stick my dick so far up that asshole she won't shit right for a week. Uuuhhh yeeeeeeeaaahhhh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that feeling when your girlfriend's long distance so these sorta things can't happen :/  

but, yeah, she's a keeper it seems like. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol you're so funny! Yeah go jack off to gamer girls somewhere else kid it was an obvious typo but you try (to hard might I add) to be funny.

____________________ TOPIC 23 ______________________________

If you look closely she's wearing a skin suit, she's not actually that large
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the real reason why armor on women is skimpy as fuck. For the Cosplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she still just put her hair up. she is some hot asiany 20something with the same glasses that entirety of 20somethings wear and big tits and a blue tanktop.



- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FFXIV is pretty good about that.

Something that's skimpy on a female character is skimpy on men and something that covers the entire body covers everything on anyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it's refreshing to see a cosplay that isn't centered around "look what an attractice woman i am, and look how big my breasts are!".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not *her*, she doesn't even do good cosplays. Always so centered around boobs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Borderline? You can almost see her labia damit. This isn't even cosplay, it's foreplay. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, speaking from experience, half of the reason you make the costumes "Sexier" is actually that wearing a full cosplay outfit all day can be HELL, I usually do it for comfort, and she might aswell.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude you're stuck on boobs look at her hips and legs for fuck sake fuck you what the fuck is wrong with you, I don't like you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mei has way bigger tits than that. The rest of her looks right though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The women in Andromeda looks like an ugly flat chested downer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You guys are the reason Hollywood photoshops bigger breasts onto girls like Keira Knightley.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always spend way too much time customizing my characters and then end up covering it in armor after a few minutes.

Maybe I should create female characters, since their armor covers up barely anything in most MMORPG's nowadays...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, she probably doesnt have such big boobs, at least not as picture 1 suggest. I think it's her bra doing the work here. 
In other picture, especially the last one, you can see her "real" boobs size.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, yes, but in most places of work both men and women wear clothing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm really into synthetic female voices. Kind of like Traynor, but less British and with smaller boobs. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Please show me this cosplay porn because I'm inclined to think you're just talking about women cosplaying a character that wears revealing clothing in which I'd tell you that you dont know what cosplay porn is

No really, I'll wait.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then you might know why she looks the way she does.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would like to see her do a Saber cosplay as well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still use the pair on the right though, there's still life in her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's going on with the lighter-blue lump on her left boob? Underwear bulge or shitty photoshop?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why dont you upvkte that girl without armor?? She got boobs. You have to upvote everything with boobs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some women half even bigger, like the size of half-dollars, or even bigger.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's lovely to see a woman cosplay without feeling the need to alter the costume to get her tits out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if I have a thing for [women in medieval armor](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;The model here probably has legs that make up 45% of her height (which is average).


Model 51.65% leg

C'mon dude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I noticed that upon reading the title again, but was pretty confused for a bit. I wear size 3.5 and my husband wears 13.5. Never known a woman to wear size 9, or a husband and wife to wear the exact same size for that matter. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she is just really insecure about her body and thinks bigger boobs will make people like her, so she keeps getting bigger and bigger implants. But then her clothes don't fit so she stretches out other sizes. Don't be so inconsiderate. Geez. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, real women vary in size in the real world. They're not all super petite, five foot nothing teddy bears.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not a joke. She has a serious cosplay, she was not looking to be objectified. She's literally wearing full genderless armour, and yet is STILL treated like the armour is lingerie. That's not cool.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is Tracer (who has a giant machine over her chest) so loved by everyone?

If you're going to cover up a chest, give me Mei any day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and I always thought that Princess Peach wore a big long dress that covered everything except her feet...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
WHAT ? 

The armor covers all of her body like it should ?! 

The fck is this ? 

You going to tell me armor shouldnt be just a bikini top and some string tangas !?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whatever dude, still hot as fuck.

girls as thicc as oatmeal usually have big butts and big boobs and less belly fat tho because of their curves
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe he/she has just been loafing around here since the last time it was posted?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh, pretty average cosplay, she should have covered the tattoos. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love that someone with small tits finally cosplayed her. She looks off with huge honkers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude adding 20-30lbs to these 5'4 game girls puts them overweight. I didn't degrade any body type. Fat doesn't = bad, I never said that. But fat is fat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The costume is great, her face is great, but her body isn't athletic enough to be Samus
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For the guys and girls that have fursuits I think *every* suit is bespoke
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, boobs that big on a fat girl is still impressive. _BUT_ they're fake. So it's cheating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your momma is so dumb she wears a diphthong for underwear. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I can't. But I mean if she was overweight or something
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She got big boobies so I call her big boobies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I first saw the glove bit on the flattened image I thought it was the back and that the pink part was her butthole. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
do you get a lot of girls pming you their tits?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she the bit with one tit bigger than the other?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's still thick, you can tell by her arms and thighs. 

Note that fat =/= thick

Basically, if she posted nudes on reddit, it'd probably be on /r/thick 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does her head look so big proportional to her body
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a boob-haver, I appreciated this too (realistic boobs yay!) but they actually jump a bit then settle back into the same plane they were on before. Put your mouse under one of her boobs while she has clothes on, her boobs will settle and end up in the same place. So, not so realistic.

____________________ TOPIC 24 ______________________________

Looking like that she can call herself whatever she wants.

That's what I love about the video game girls, man...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
graduate school isn't a job?  you can study game design at other schools and I wasn't saying men were "better off" financially.  I was saying it's probably better to attend a program that is competitive and not one that is signing up women only to look progressive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There should be a Lv.99 girl in a golden bikini as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There were no men playing that, just boys and some girls. 

So it separated the boys from the boys.

The best female character of the first 43 days of 2016*

Young girls often don't know what they really want in a guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Petch looks like she's got some coconut cream pies for us. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shit my first time drunk in high school I drank three Miller high lifes and that was all she wrote. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just me or is this what literally every girl at the gym looks like
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
12 year old girls look like that where you're from?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Her name? She goes to another school, you probably don't know her."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Joel should still be in his late 40s while ellie looks like she's in her late teens
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are a lot of jobs that have down time. My wife works really hard but there are days when she just doesn't have much to do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What sort of mileage do you get? I have an 85 Camaro (with the 305 v8), and she gets about 19 mpg, and I think that's pretty good. An Rx7 must get better than that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My typical day is work from 7 to 4, gym with wife from 5 to 630/7, cook dinner and hang out until she goes to bed then play games for an hour or two afterwards. 

That's just on gym days. Non gym days it's pretty much the same without the gym, we just hang out more. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah Violet Berlin, now that I am older than she is in this video, I actually find her quite cute. But where the fuck did Andy Crane's career go? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only way she can get a MAN these days.  ;-)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let me guess, she was either a high school student or an immature college student.

No sane, decent human being would do that preemptively. Man or Woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Um, she could of done that with JavaScript or Python. Have you taught her how to program? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean the historical age for women to start giving birth?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well all of my close friends are girls, so I don't (despite how nice they look).  But I'm also antisocial and ugly so maybe I'm am exception
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
is the monkey a woman? i thought the monkey was male, why is it being spoken of as if it were not male?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This looks like a great way for older guys to meet teenage girls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah, it's all staged, the girl pretends to see the ghoul the first time in her life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok be honest. If you got *that good* at a game, do you really think you'd have time to meet girls?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure no one called her ugly in middle school. I know I wanted believe in the code.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why did we get downvoted? If this is because people think I'm a horny teenage boy, I'm really not. I'm a 16 year old girl, and I like her makeup. It's done well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this guy only fuck girls between 1 and 12 y o?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you see her without makeup for the first time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a woman and no, I am not that smart! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a nice life you've got there. I take it you have a job and a girlfriend?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's a nice setup for her age. 10yr old me would have loved to have hardware that could play 30fps. Back in the 90s I'd often end up playing games at what was probably 10-15fps.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Megan Golden

Ah, so she's a country singer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got late to a test today because I was masturbating to her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So if she was 12 you'd be all for it?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You've never been on Minecraft haven't you?

Girl: Can I have some diamonds?
Boy: Take mine
Boy: Take mine to
Boy: me three
Boy: want to be my girlfriend I'm 9
Boy: I have butter
Boy: kill the squids!
Boy Here's some
Boy: I got you.
Boy: This naked mod is so hot the blocks are so real
Boy: Say 123 if you want a girlfriend
Boy: Here you go

1054 points. Title: "the best female character of 2016." It's a motherfucking hand holding a motherfucking walkie-talkie.

Are you shitting me, people?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like I don't want to be "that girl" but it's Ar*k*ane ._. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's no way.  If she's 12 then I'm a pedophile.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is extremely predictable on her middle east policy. Chaos and destruction.
You want more of that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a fact that she has gotten younger since middle school.

Normal stuff but it was a lot older. Vintage shit with all the girls hairy all over 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do you mean? 

How does working in an office of primarily women, make women more naturally prone to being insecure? 

Surely it would have been learned at a younger age than most people working in an office? 

And if it's not learned (Which I'm pretty sure it is) then it would have been assigned at birth anyway so I'm struggling to see what the office has to do with it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not about boy vs girl. It's older sibling vs younger.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ask him if he is a boy or a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ironically, no women are employed here or no women were pictured. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't she have a British accent? The old one actually looks British.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always see this gif and give points to the driver. I don't know if I would have thought fast enough to embarrass her like that. I'm sure the best I could do would be honking the horn. Congrats to this driver for their quick thinking and smart maneuvers.

Bioshock 1


Tried to drain the girls on my 2nd playthrough


Drained the first girl, watched what happened. (The first one you meet in the pipe)

Couldn't do it again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The horror man, bail before you have kids! Next thing you know she'll want you to help change diapers, and watch the little troglodytes for girls night out!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She said to stop by and visit before she left and I went and she was already gone. What a bitch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My niece was born in 03 and she loved my NES until it stopped working a few weeks ago. So yeah I don't see how people would think that out of the ralm of possibilities 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 4 and it was Christmas morning.  We were through all of the presents as far as my mom knew.  Can't fool me.  I saw it sitting there tucked in the corner behind the tree.

I kept asking for the last present and she kept telling me there are no more.  I finally crawled behind the tree and grabbed it.

My mom couldn't figure out what it was.  I later found out my dad bought it without her knowing.  

As I tore back the paper I was extremely excited.  NES with Mario Brothers.  That Christmas morning started a hobby I still have 30 years later.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I was dating someone and they went through even a 10th of as much effort as she's gone through for him I'd be excited and have that happy vomity feeling you get when you think someone actually cares for you.

When you live in rural areas the girl brings her new boyfriend home who is actually her cousin.

I was worse but not more succesfull. I realized that habbo was full of suckers actually trying to get girls online, or atleast they liked the idea of it. So I played a girl and started charming these guys, making them wanna move in with me, in my room ofc I'll need ur furniture im the woman in the house! After a couple of times I felt like a complete whore and just... stopped.

Habbo had some really fun shit tho, kickwars, RP, banter..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Terraria, although I couldn't get my girlfriend to play it. It's worth a look
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you kill her? Because if she pulled that shit I wouldn't let her stay there for for very long
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend thought for sure that was a joke and that me and her dad were in on it, till months later I brought it up again that I really do see gold.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the Ewoks. The woman went from a little startled to "Fuck this shit."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your family should want you to be happy, not suffocated. You have to live your life for *you* not for them, not for your cousin, not for your girlfriend. For *you* and all those awesome characters *you* are in video games! Be happy man! Don't settle for anything less!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My parents sat me and my girlfriend down when we last visited them and told us my brother was bitten by an alligator. My dad followed up by saying that the alligator had AIDS when they found it so now my brother has Gator-AIDS. My parents were so proud of that joke.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kids are only young once, I miss having my gaming time some days but I'll only be able to play with my little girl at 3 years old for so long before she's 4, then 5, etc.

Eventually she'll be old enough that I can pass the torch and see if she wants to start playing WITH her old man - but for now I'll keep my playtime to after she is in bed or napping.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was in college I bought an n64 from a local pawn shop just to play drunk Mario Kart 64. I'm a female who lived with 3 other girls, they gave me shit until they got drunk and played it. It was the center piece of our living room. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
hey we spent ALOT of time together but she takes 2 naps a day so it got pretty boring 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah what's that about? I really miss split screening with friends. Even my girlfriend wanted to play with me but couldn't. So dumb.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vivian for mine. Vivie for short. Something about the way she looks kept bringing a Viv type sound to mind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
probably Tetris on the Game Boy. (original)

after that it would be counterstrike pre 1.6, it was like, even before school an hour sometimes, then immediately after school till sleep and even on the weekends. i did stuff like "play 24h on our server"- events or whatever that was. don't know how many hundreds of hours, of maybe thousands.

then i became aware of beer and girls.

nowadays its rocketleague. i have about 460h since last summer.

I let my 5 year old niece play BK a few weeks ago. Between the clams, mines, and snacker (which made her freak out and start screaming) she had me finish Treasure Trove Cove for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty much the same here. I've been with my gf for a while and when we get married there will be no surprises as to what the other likes to do for fun or what they dont want to do. 

My gf enjoys watching me play games and I enjoy helping her bake cookies (which ... I reap rewards for, admittedly)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love seeing stuff like this, look how happy she is to be making something she things her dad/family enjoys!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's mostly my dad, my mom is actually pretty darn cool about things. Only reason I got my stuff back after only a couple of days is because she fought on my side the whole way. Unfortunately things aren't so equal in my house so if he decides to take them away again she can't do much for me. I do want to look into leaving, but I need to be in a better position to do so. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not everyone lives with their SO. Or maybe she got home early?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol I would only watch G4 if there was the sexiest women around the world TV show at night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I shit you not, Todd Howard looks just like my girlfriend's mom.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Got it from "Santa" for Christmas about the time Donkey Kong 64 came out, so I got the Jungle Green console that came packaged with DK64. Me and my younger brother would often go to our playroom and find Dad playing DK64 by himself. When we got old enough to stop believing in Santa we figured that Dad (who wasn't a gamer himself) just bought the N64 because he wanted to play Donkey Kong.

Other memories: 

-Borrowing my cousin's copy of Goldeneye and never returning it (in my defense, he never asked for it back).

-Beating my brother at just about every multiplayer game we ever played, and sometimes letting him win because I'm a nice older brother like that.

-Getting really scared by Queen Gohma in Zelda: OoT because I'm really arachnophobic. So even though she was the first boss I was stuck on her for months. I kind of miss Zelda games being scary, actually.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I try to stay away from sorority girls - especially trideltas
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I met her last month, and I'll be seeing her again this weekend! She's an absolute sweetheart
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My 7 year old sister still describes it as the "unicorn worm." she's excited to catch them every time they pop up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Our local Hooters a few months back had Heros of the Storm on. I was the only one among my friends who new what it was.

I need new friends...

At least my wife was close, she asked me if it was LoL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Does she start showing up more often later on?

Sadly no, i'd say that she starts showing up even less.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a similar experience, GF wasn't great with the two thumbsticks. I think the key is that if you play strategically, there are very few "quick" moments in the game. She got better at the sticks because she enjoyed this game so much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember last time this was posted there was a story about a guy that tried to do this but his wife to be was shitty at games. So she tried for about 20 min before eventually giving up on beating the game. Which sparked a huge fight that ended up being the genesis of their breakup. Super sad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she was pretty terrible at her first couple E3 presentations.  she's gotten better though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A long time ago,  some friends of mine's little boy lost his tooth before bedtime and was absolutely heart broken.   My friend called my mom,  whom the kids had never met,  and she pretended to be the tooth fairy.   She told him not to worry about it,  as she was really good at finding teeth.   After he went to sleep,  they snuck a dollar under his pillow with a note that said "found it!". She ended up calling him whenever he lost a tooth after that.   When he finally met her,  he recognized her voice and was amazed that my mom was the tooth fairy.   Or at least he played it off pretty good.   No idea when he stopped believing it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom admitted a few years ago that she "stopped learning years ago". I couldn't believe it. I asked her to repeat herself. She did. It was terrible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This reminds me of a friend of mine. Her boyfriend told her that he would use his tax return to either buy a new TV or buy her an engagement ring. She was excited and assumed he told her this to say without saying he was getting her an engagement ring. She came home the next day to see that he had bought a new TV. She broke up with him soon after. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure no one will believe me, but she looks really similar to my ex
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I vaguely remember her past, but don't remember a drinking problem o.O
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Omg you two are the best big siblings ever. I remember playing on my older brother's SNES with him and my dad when I was younger, I ended up being the lone gamer.

She is a lucky lucky girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've always felt that if my mom had me a little younger, she would have been a great gaming partner. We played left for dead together a couple of times and it was a hilarious fun time because we both sucked at it, but she's always super interested in what I'm playing. Unfortunately I play via a PC hooked to a 65" TV in a small room with just enough space for a recliner, so having two people in there just didn't work comfortably in the long term.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom was always sick when I was young so my grandma lived with us. My grandma made sure I knew how much she hated me everyday. I couldn't stand being home so I spent all my time at the arcades instead of hanging out with hoodlums. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right! that letter was fully-loaded... anyways I learned some new moves you could try on your new girlfriend if you think you can handle em'
hold X+O then -&gt; ^ &lt;- &lt;- ^ -&gt; or for a finishing move go forward/back really fast 13 times.
cya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I do that too, my girlfriend kept wondering why we were at about the same time but I had 10+ more hours than her... because I was playing, paused to go do something, and came back a couple hours later to continue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude I know went to a dinner with his lady at another couples place, after dinner the couple put on twitchTV for entertainment. They weren't entertained. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me neither. When I first heard her singing I fell in love, but when the end of the game hit I knew I had to do this.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was the one where Lily is mad that Ted brought a random hoe to her birthday party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Diablo. If she likes it you won't get away from the computers anymore!

Who needs a wife or girlfriend when you have all that vr porn? Obby
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Along with the fact that she's not attracted to you sexually
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; no one is bangin that broad.

What? Girls like sex too you know. Just because she is unattainable for you doesn't mean she doesn't have sex lmao.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is me asking why men aren't sexualized in the same way as women somehow shaming you? I don't think you know what the buzzwords you're clumsily repeating actually mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I identify as a female, will I be allowed to join? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got it specifically for co-op with my girl and she's basically obsessed with the game at this point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is your girlfriend sing-...I wanna have sex with your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is a minor now. You thought about having sex with her. It doesn't matter if you say "when she is 18". You sexualized her because you thought about having sex with her. I will not further argue with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she enjoyed the Lego Harry Potter games, why not try other Lego games?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a euphemism, it's not gender biased. But congratulations on being female. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You probably won't make it to the top because you aren't an attractive woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right. Keep watching porn while I fuck your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We all know it was some sort of fighting type move, since she is obviously a normal type. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are more picky than me my good man.  That is a definite would as is.  Of course I had thing for her for decades.  I am a sucker for redheads.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doing that is the non-lethal route, you can also just straight up kill her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No no. I like porn. I didn't like what this guy liked though (vintage, hairy women)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;You do realize that giving people HRT actually makes them get the sexual desires of the opposite sex, right?

actually trans HRT rarely makes a MTF person attracted to guys, or a FTM person attracted to girls

&gt;I must have missed that one

[here] (
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like me and her might still have sex
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
transgender is male and/or female.

better? Or should it be;

transgender is male and/or/nor female.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SSSNIPERWOLF.  It use to be SexySexySniperwolf,  she was a straight up slut there,  but that was before she found that slave that would do anything for her and she made a new channel.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This type of shit gets frontpaged and you guys still act like sexualization of women in video games doesn't happen. smfh.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thing is this was true before online gaming was a thing.  In my experience it really just tends not to appeal to women... most guys I find are interested and want to try, most women I show games to just say "I don't get it can we do something else?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Old Video, maybe she flipped her views to appeal to the Youth Vote 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"cis" women

You mean normal women or actual women? Most people just call them women because that's what they are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then there's the guy she's not telling you about aka Titanfall 2. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Toys for Bob were really pandering to the female audience there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"look at my profile for more content" 

*goes to her profile*

Well, it IS definitely some kind of content
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually I think the majority of people don't care if their avatar is male or female, in most games your avatar's gender has no effect gameplay, so choosing not to play it simply because there is no female avatar is really quite shallow. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just drop the trans adjective, and you have your answer. So a trans woman is a woman, and a trans man is a man. But Scarlett is a trans woman, and so the earlier poster was incorrect to call her a dude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a survey the other day that asked for gender. Male, female, transgender or other....WTF is other....pony?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then it shows her looking surprised when she falls, she obviously thought she could lean there because of her gender, I love how you avoid obvious things like that, great fun
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and sex... but that can be sorted by wonder woman 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Male or female. They are different people, not just a gender swap
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You realize the person you just responded to is her right haha?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually think that's a girl... not that it matters, amirite? /highfive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shannon's first experience in Virtual Reality.  She was really brave considering she hates horror games. Putting on the Oculus is like being right there in those halls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
its quite obvious she thinks its because of her gender, girls are always like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost as if men and women are attracted to different features in each other.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are not "assigned" a gender, you are identified as being either male or female. You either accept the body were born with or you don't. You can either accept a fundamental fact of life, or you can be delusional and try to twist all matters of facts and reality to fit that delusion. You can either be indifferent to or embrace what you are, or can cry and be miserable about what you are not.  You either have gender dysphoria or you don't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I stopped being attracted to video games and started talking to real women. Because you know, you can actually do things with them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
my only beef here is that you can't say women in general want ANY job. there is no general job that most women want. just like dudes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Online multiplayer...  Is going to be men pretending they are women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those are just cyclists that have sex with both men and women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Idk man bring a normal girl there and see how that goes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;she

&gt;C U R R E N T Y E A R and still using gendered pronouns?

*triggered*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shes not having sex with anyone, for one. And way to insult females because you are a butthurt 30 year old virgin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of females to choose from in the last 4 Call of Duty games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They exist IRL too. But the shells are tiny. 

One is even marketed as a 'woman's CCW'.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if the student doesn't identify as male or female? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just still your gender but gay, you'd probably put your sperm into a woman.

Of course she survived it. You're playing on super easy mode.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesn't ever get tired of carrying my shit. She always dies in the first dungeon after I get her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That might be why. I don't think I talked to him after I talked to the hanged lady. This will make things much easier. Thanks.

My fianc√© hated playing FPS because she couldn't use the twin sticks. I had her try Portal since she could just take her time with it and she loves solving puzzles. Needless to say, she was having a blast and started to get the hang of the controls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I glanced upon the jeans she had put on that day, and found myself addicted, and unable to stop staring.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's 11mo so I'm sure she could handle a rogue or hunter at this point

I miss mama jokes.

Yo mama so fat her blood type is Ragu

I used to pick pretty daisies.

She looks like she smokes weed out of an apple.

She's one of my favorites. I don't know why it screwed her's up so much.

yo mama is not yo mama because yo not her son and she not yo mama. Fixed it for you.

It's not like playing her is crazy difficult or anything, so there's his first mistake

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She didn't learn how to do that on her own. Beware of a side man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think that's how you pick up girls &gt;.&gt;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Their water dragoon was a mermaid, I always wanted to know how they found her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Megaman is challenging if your a preteen girl. Battletoads is for real men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A female dog, i1m pretty sure, is spelt as Chienne.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Trying to get the wife to look into playing this with me.  Co-op looks to be a lot of fun.  Though this might be a bit too fast paced for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was that one guys girlfriend that liked portal, maybe you should show her portal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depends on what kind of games she likes. If she's not a hardcore gamer, or is just interested in visuals and story I'd recommend some of the Telltale games. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll teach her the many combinations of 1 and 0.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try playing Conker's Bad Fur day. I watch my girlfriend play and it stresses ME out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just looked it up.  It is.  It's cheap.  It's amazing.  My wife doesn't like video games, but she played this (before giving up when the difficulty cranked up).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'd think it's a generational thing, but I saw some woman in her 60s do the same thing yesterday.  Damn near wanted to run her down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you have taught her nothing else... you have taught her patience.  Patientia est virtus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should totally do this! Go camping and teach him/her primitive fire and trapmaking techniques!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's setting her up so he can tickle his pickle
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was pretty much a female Hunter Thompson, plus people are being all pissy like they knew her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you stop looking at all the girlfriend simulators a so often they should at least show up less often in your queue
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*BMMMMM* **BMMMMM!!** Call yo mama in the room and show her how great you are!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plenty of reasons one might do that. The main one is "Lydia got stuck somewhere and/or I can't locate her." Fast travelling can sometimes unstick her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just sneak in food and drink in your girlfriend's/wife's/own purse.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She will take half of your sweet rolls when she gets bored with you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Oh, I needed to JUMP and throw her. My bad."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really wanted to see a train run over the hogtied woman in 4k.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't know she had the GI Joe, Kung Fu grip
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
actually me and my GF are enjoying Unravel currently, she plays while i watch and when she gets stuck we figure out what we need to do next. its a cute little puzzle game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend's name is Amber.

I too, am fond of Amberlamps...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would give her tongue as Yoshi. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does her game even run?

Sims 2 had some nasty memory issues and that's almost 14gb of stuff the game would have to constantly keep track of.

____________________ TOPIC 28 ______________________________

The sidekick idea came with the problem of having to share character development time between all of your comrades. If there was a partner you never used (and it was Flurrie) then you never heard him/her talk, meaning you didn't get to know that one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks exactly like I would expect a female redditor to look. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Idk, she's been getting a steady 3-4k on each video she's made since then. I'm sure she's content with that.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope. The game is linked to her account. You would have to game share her account to keep it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Plenty of places would take issue with an employee looking at pictures of women in bikinis.

Why? What if the person works at Sports Illustrated?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not sure if gifting her some early access indie shit is a good deed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he/she was mentioning that you listed "Xbox One S" as one of your top picks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Um just get steam. The game is cheap and unless you pirate it which you shouldn't do she can't play. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Religion already has. For example, [here's a quote]( about her from the bible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And when she does a chargeback you will also have your account(s) banned.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Credit where it's due - It's Ilona Bugaeva, [check out her instagram.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm just the artist, the material prices and stuff is handled by my older sis X3 you can contact her with the info on the site, sorry!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well considering skyward sword is the first in the timeline of current games released that link got the girl and the rest after didn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shouldn't he/she use the time on the game not the time of the real world?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If they are for personal use, then it isn't an issue.  Your title suggested your girlfriend's business is going to be producing and selling the stickers in the image.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had to check because I wasn't sure, no, her name is Kristen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she paid with credit/debt contact them and put a hold on the funds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Fate State Nite Ying-Yang knives SET"



Can you slap the owner? With the back of the hand, please. Make him/her go back to childhood and think why not just check the name on the internet...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Both Outrider and Battery are female specialists, and they are available at level 1.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The artist was probably trying  to figure out it it's a boy or girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And she's done nude modeling, since so many of the guys that follow her online can't figure that out. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no, but then again i was too busy fooling around with the neighbor girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she put it on a credit card do a charge back.  Fuck best buy for this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't get me Started, had a girl that would check out other guys all the time then go crazy if I even looked in the direction of another woman 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is a really beautiful piece of art :) Tell her that I said that :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not that she has more than most people, she just has never ever deleted any. If I did the same, my account would look something like that as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Video games don't cause violence, lag does.

But seriously, they don't. Maybe you could write about how video games influence people who would already be violent anyways. For example, there was one case where some girls imitated slender man and tried to murder another girl. Other than that, it's a research paper, so do some research.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This so much, though she always calls it "Intendo."

But we did have an Intellivision, so credit where due.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Delusional sexism? Sheesh.

26% of the consumer market is a small subset in that there is a huge book market outside of romance. The point is that if you are a guy, there is plenty of reading material for you out there. If you're a girl, there is plenty of reading material for you, too. The same can't be said about video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the idea is just that he can't legally say which company he works for. It's prior to the big Tyler changeover so he's still trying to protect his ass in some small way. So he can explain how it works but stops short of naming names so the woman can't go immidiatly to the press or authorities with the information she just received.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah she laughing all the way to the bank with your remark. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was bill gates. He probably accessed her online data in order to get everything so spot on. Coukdnt be coincidence.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I deleted Trivia Crack when it was the only game my wife was playing on her phone, and then we started seeing charges on our phone bill for random things we didn't want. Their use of ads which automatically signed you up for things was underhanded and unacceptable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Text her email and tell her to save that email address and you will be texted when she emails you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how her tech rig has a can of soda in it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She does if you talk to her and tell her you did it, but she doesn't recognize you or anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"we have no plans yet but that's a good idea!" 

.... That can't be his/her first time hearing that or even the though passing through their head. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was wondering if I just launched steam on her laptop in offline mode and mine in online mode since I would most likely require the online portions.  Does that work?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just out of interest, could you provide some examples of inaccurate claims she's made?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that is his plan.. I'm no law wiz but wouldn't suing someone over property rights get her/him far more money than selling copies would?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do I have to spell it out for you?  Maybe she was "seeing" the guy already before she told you... and that might have been related to the "fungal" infection...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a link to where you can view and buy prints of her stuff:

Really good work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some banks *never* delete information. When I was opening my bank account at my current bank, I had my family have access in case I died.  I glanced over when they were added me to my mother's accessible account and noted that they had my ten year deceased uncle under her list of accounts she can access, in red text. I commented on it an the woman opening my account said that I "wasn't suppose to see that", and that they keep the accounts reserved, but inactive.

I'm assuming in the case that there is some kind of legal trouble.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My main issue is that it isn't available for windows phone. But my girlfriend has an Iphone that I commandeer, so I guess it's okay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Anyone know what kind of materials she used to make this?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No she doesn't. You have to put it down in order for her to cuddle it which means you already stopped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There have been a few websites listed, but I feel none of these are fixing the problem: she downloads bloatware, spyware, etc. What you should do is make two users. Make one of them your name and make it the administrator and give it a password. Make the other one her name and don't give her user download privileges. Make sure you also make sure she only uses one web browser (delete the others) and download addblock plus. This way she wont see all these adds in the sidebar as she plays and she won't click them. If she wants to download something, have her tell you and you make sure it is safe. If it isn't tell her, if it is, download it for her next time you are over there on your admin user.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So why did you make her go outside to pick up your amazon order when you were already outside next to it? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my coffee, I don't like coffee. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I pressed her A and immoderately got a restraining order

____________________ TOPIC 29 ______________________________

To this day, I still haven't seen that video from Shia. It's sort of like how I haven't seen 2 girls 1 cup. By the time I hear about it, everyone's already done talking about it, so I know what it's about already.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
hot damn diggity, was I surprised when she keeled over and croaked
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Had no idea what it was until I saw what she said. Damn I'm slow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I forget to text back girls/know their existence when I'm gaming lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mentioned fucking Emma Watson, my head just FILLED with possibilities, damn you. Why did you have to say her name when it could have been anyone!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she was so embarrassed why is she telling anybody about it online?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I installed the game for my wife, and she's never played it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haven't seen it yet, but I see two girls and a unicorn. Should I be scared?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
damn this game looks awesome. I screamed like a little girl...a really..manly...little girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why would she need to work out if she is God to earthlings. If you were Superman, what point of working out would there be? Might actually be funnier if you were slenderish but strong as god.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean you didn't follow her into the mirror? You monster. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those girls look like the least coordinated people I have ever seen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to imagine that you playing a video game is the same to her as watching a superlong movie with lots of bloopers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Holy crap, how is this girl doing this? Seriously I need to know!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this game a sausage fest or something?  

Haven't seen one female character, at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You forgot that the woman goes on a homicidal rampage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was, but Mean Girls made her a star. That Herbie movie wasn't all that good. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Heads up: you might not want to google that name in the gif. Without the PSN prefix that's an anal prolapse porn actress. (and she is very good.)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is my biggest hang up with this whole thing. If it was just her, sure, remove it. But every damned character has the same god damned pose! Fuck off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lmao i thought that dude(second to the right) looked like a woman too but yeah its just clean looking guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They look awesome! Tell her to keep up the good work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn she just got roasted.  She is probably already regretting it and she has had for like a day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you don't know what a guy looks like either because you thought a girl looked like a guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I guess she does kind of have a look of, "oh. When did that get there?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what sucks is the camera angle. There was a god damned Chinook helicopter under her... I wanna see that mess getting made.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a fan of Amie's for so long it sucks to see everyone thinking she is actually mad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because you know when doesn't mean you know where.

You find her in 1892.  You search New York.  

Sucks to be you, she is actually in China.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh god, what the fuck does she do in hail?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jenny? Wasn't her name Claer? Or is this some reference I don't get? I haven't played the game much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just remember, if you aren't charming enough to flirt with women, just take drugs!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Remember, folks: 

If you could've used 'him' or 'her', you should be using 'whom'.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Valykries are female right?  Maybe it's Loki or another god spying on Kratos and his kid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagine she's watching a feed of all the webcams installed in the easels.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These people are going to forget how to even talk to women and start groping them. Jeez.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love that strip so much because i have a friend who is a huge superman fan. When i showed it to her she said alfred was cheating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's really great at knitting actually. she makes awesome apple pie and sucks a mean dick.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
oh, this one is so old, and I'm not talking about the girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh come on now. We all know she doesn't play video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a pixar movie of a little girl who thinks everyone loves her in *that* way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My offsprings could cartwheel out of her oven maker with those hips. Lordy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goddamn it, now i'm always going to think that when I see her name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If kratos is a woman here whose ashes are those?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's just the Aiming she ain't very good at it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is also like trying to mess around with my girlfriend when she's pissed off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never played the older games, but now that I think about it the Angelina Jolie movie had her living in a manor with a butler.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but "I don't really speak russian, but my friend did, so she talked to them." one of em was a girl...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, i guess i could play a game with your girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh Damn I saw her on epiccon, she really pulled this off
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Defiently looks more like the actress who plays her now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey, hey, she's had a long time to mature, ok?

____________________ TOPIC 30 ______________________________

Don't show her mods or she'll never actually play the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The story is very deep. There are a lot of "talky bits" for her to take over and her decisions there will have a great impact on how the story plays out.

As one of the tool tips puts it, your decisions will decide the fates of characters and sometimes entire communities.

I just finished the MQ of the second expansion and I'm at 150 hours into game. I still have 10-15 side quests to finish and there is a NG+ mode which is good for going through and exploring different branches of the story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One thing I will give to Fallout 4 is that you do have three and a half main factions you can side with rather than just the option to kill yourself and/or everyone in Fallout 3- that is later retconned. 

It's also nice to be able to go full-on with one faction or another. I just got to the part where I met the railroad, saved, and proceeded to murder the shit out out Desmonda and the rest of her crew. None of those main characters were essential so I could just murder the other faction and be on my way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm 51 and I play sometimes, to a few selected games. Currently I'm finishing Fallout  4 for the 5th time (as a woman, this time. My wife was a bit jelous of Piper and Cait and Curie.. ..)

Every bad game has good people behind it. Throwing bile at devs is rarely justified. It sucks to see people like that one Dragon Age 2 writer get a ton of hate just because she said the wrong thing at the wrong time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fallout 4 looked pretty indeed, but the woman and dogmeat should have been on the front.

There is a lot of different approaches to the game, each with different outcomes. You can basically ruin your own story by making the wrong choices, for example; you can save that man's wife and thus her husband. This is just the top of the iceberg as you can totally fuck up the main story as well. That being said, it feels amazing to have to carefully think about your decisions as you will develop such sympathy with the characters in this game, that you will actually hate yourself for having bad outcomes

What I actually hope for is Ciri showing up in Cyberpunk 2077 as a minor cameo. She did say that [she's traveled to a world where people had metal in them and fought remotely with devices like a megascope](/spoiler)

Any of the Lego series. I play these games with my girlfriend all the time. Kind of a grind sometimes, but the LotR ones are pretty spectacular.

Or that the npc sees a mob way off the path and goes to engage it. Then once combat ends, the npc stands still while the game figures out the best path to get back to where the npc left the pre-determined path. Even if he/she ran ahead to engage mobs, they always run back to where they left the path!

On the other hand in games like DayZ there is nothing less immersive than having a radnom encounter with someone sounding like a twelve year old girl.

My nydus worm has spewed so many banelings into her base.

CD Projekt Red is the best developer out there, when taking everything under consideration. There is no one over or beside them. There is only them. No contest.

Kudos and thank you for an unforgettable journey with the Witcher series. You guys and girls are awesome!

Bioshock's the only one that actually had that in a dlc, it was one of Infinite's dlcs where you play as Elizabeth, everything but her was in black and white at times.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I said to myself, "Is there a new dlc that lets you play more as Batgirl?!"  Then I felt sad again.  Like normal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would be against it. Why not make a new game,a spin-off or even a completely new game, with a female protagonist? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think you're missing the most important part about this entire debacle though, and that is that the game allowed you to have a mammoth creature take a shit on women and children for the enjoyment of the player. That game was a solid 10/10. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It really wasn't much of a game, but it was a very solid interactive story.  I loved that I had the kind of control I had over her actions, and I felt like it was one of the few games I've played where my decisions really mattered.  When she experienced heartache, I felt that with her.  When she was happy or excited, I felt that too.  It was a rewarding experience, to be sure, but not one I had any interest in repeating.  I didn't get the perfect ending, I didn't *save* everyone, and that kind of sucked.  I would have liked to fully complete the game, but once I had beaten it, I didn't feel like it was an experience I'd want to repeat.  Subsequent play-throughs would have, I think, cheapened the experience.

Maybe she wants revenge for the girraffee's that are klled

The Lord of the Rings Online.

It's got nice graphics, neither too bad nor too good. Servers like Landroval and Laurelin allow role-playing, and you can find lots of RPers there. (Especially in the Prancing Pony) If she likes LotR, she'll like this too. 

There are also cosmetic items so that you can customize your character even more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, her like full character model.  She's sorta one of the major players for the story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While my wife grumbles along playing Witcher 3 as only a male character. She loves the game, just wishes she could pick a female. 

Is there a mod for that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish you had made it "a man searching for his son", while this could still work for girls who play FO4, lets be honest the majority of players are probably male
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; One of the staples of an rpg is that you have choice. Fallout 4 steamlined everything to the point where you dont really have much choice. 

Yes we all know this by now, no need to keep regurgitating it. Its STILL an RPG. Just because certain rpg aspects arent as good as they could be doesnt mean its just not an rpg at all. Thats absolutely retarded. 

The fact of the matter is that rpg stands for roleplaying game. In Fallout 4 you create your own character, you CHOOSE what he/she/it looks like, you CHOOSE what they wear, you CHOOSE which abilities to upgrade. To say that it isnt an rpg at all because it doesnt have as many speech options as FO3/NV is just retarded. 

Tl;dr: just because it isnt a perfect RPG doesnt mean it isnt an RPG at all.

Songbird =(

I really felt bad. It did seem to love her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he is immersed in another reality.. How much does he actually like her..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think both gameplay and characters can evolve a little each game. Character much more so than gameplay, cause there's only so many stories one character has in him/her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it did, it was a very rudimentary version. Crysis 1 is also not the pretty girl she once was without mods. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My GF loved watching me play life is strange and the horror one (can't remember the name).

Pretty much any decision based game as she could enjoy the story and help make decisions - like why she decided to go out with such a nerd in the first place. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a bonus, use "setessential a2c94 1" to make her never die (she goes into a downed state until combat ends).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Peggle. My girlfriend isn't a gamer and she loves it. Its "cutesy" and has adorable characters, plus simple gameplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't play Witcher 3 or FFVII so I didn't experienced this on my own.

There should be more games with choices that have an impact on the story/characters.

I think Mass Effect made that pretty good with the choices you made in the Suicide Mission. I don't think we need a way to bring back Characters that would just devalue the character and the bond you made over time with him/her.

The players actions and choices should lead to either saving the character or letting him/her die not provide a cheap way out by bringing the character back to life. Most games nowadays are more linear in they story telling. We have Great open worlds which can be explored but still have such a linear approach.

There was a female lead in a popular video game series? The first one was released back in 1986?

B...but Women were supposed to be underrepresented in video games!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More like she likes Persona 4 than the entire series in general. I could be wrong but I don't see any of the others in there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well you have a backstory in FO4. 

Didn't try the game as a woman (bore me to death already with one character so..) but as a man, you're supposed to be a veteran. You also should have done a speech at the local school so maybe an important veteran.

And then you go into the wasteland and get shittalked by stupid BoS. Fuck off Bethesda.

Compared to sayyy the AI standard in modern video games to the likes of claptrap. I enjoyed the system and it was fluid and pretty bug free. I liked using it and being able to chose my style of play using the different options being presented with. 

But idk maybe you're right and the DLC just made me more biased towards her character and my love for her. She's perfect üòç

Fully agree.  Witcher is so overrated.  Yah it is a good looking game, but the combat sucks, the magic powers are pretty much useless, all the monsters are roughly the exact same, all the weapons are basically the same, the armor looks like the puffy pirate shirt from Seinfeld, it is a game that I just do not understand the hype.  I could not get into the lore and felt like every mission was ok kill this monster and comeback and get a reward, or save this chick and then fuck her, and then go save another chick, fuck her and save the world.  Also there were way too many useless items, and my inventory is like 99% stuff I would never use.  I could go on forever about how average this game is and will probably get downvoted for it.  When playing the witcher the only thing I could think was, damn this is not as good as skyrim, I should go back and play that.  I basically beat the game, and then deleted it off my ps4, and will never play it again.

They're all worth playing. I think 1 is the best, and 2 is the worst. My wife adores 3 and it's one of her favorite games. They're a good time, for sure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chrono trigger!!!!! My favorite rpg as a young girl. Well second favorite FF6 forever!

People on reddit complain about everything. If someone gave them $100 million they'd complain about the taxes and having to drive across town to pick it up. And really it'd be a lot more convenient if they just direct deposited the money instead of giving them a check...

The story was decent, it wasn't like groundbreaking storytelling/writing, but Fallout has never been about that (at least not in many years). In fact Bethesda has never been about that. They're good at one thing - creating a really visually appealing and immersive world that you get to explore and enjoy. If you like open world sandboxes with incredible details, interesting buildings/areas to explore, and easter eggs everywhere, then you'll enjoy Fallout 4.

If you don't care about that stuff but want really good plotlines and writing, or really good combat, then Fallout is not and never has been for you. The combat and writing is not atrocious, it's just not great.

I will say that one thing this game has that the previous versions have never had is the playable character's dialogue, which is staggeringly expansive. They must have spent a year alone on each character (one male, one female) talking to every random little character throughout the entire world. It's crazy. In previous games you just select what your character says, but your character doesn't actually speak the lines in-game, only the NPCs speak at all.

The graphics are fine, I don't know how anybody can complain. Especially when the modding community for these games is and has always been so ridiculous. There's already a bunch of visual mods, and I usually mod the shit out of games, but this one I didn't think needed it (plus the stock game already stresses out my computer haha). I played Metal Gear Solid V just before Fallout and the graphics are approximately equally good in my opinion. 

RPG elements are about par for the Bethesda course, in fact probably a little better than usual. New Vegas was probably the best in this regard, since you can choose widely different factions and they have very interesting pros and cons (New Vegas wasn't Bethesda though). This game has a little bit less variation between the factions, but it's still fairly interesting.

In my opinion Fallout 4 was very good. Not the best game ever, but extremely fun and had me addicted for about 70 hours solid. Now, I played New Vegas and Skyrim for about 200/300 hours each, but then again those have been out for a long time. But to the question "is it even good?" My answer is an emphatic, "Yes!"

I've had a playthrough with everyone except Aurelia.  If and when you do decide to fire up TPS I have maybe some tips of who to play.  It might drastically change your overall experience of the game (but then again it might not depending on what you loved most about BL2). Nisha was probably my least favorite character (outside of Aurelia).  Her special was too OP and took away a lot of fun.  Wasn't much of a challenge with her.  Athena was enjoyable, but I found her to be a different experience than most of the other characters. 

* Handsome Jack Doppelganger.  One of my favorite characters in TPS.  Has a very cool action skill, his lines of dialogue are quite entertaining, and can solo.  Unless you absolutely hated Handsome Jack as a character, this one is a must play as.
* Wilhem.  I'd compare him to Axton only except his turret flies.  Probably isn't going to make you laugh.  Character itself was pretty plain.  Wish they would have explored him more considering what he had become in BL2.  Wolf and Saint absolutely crush enemies in TPS. Also, is relatively easy for solo play.
* Claptrap.  He's either my 1st or 2nd favorite playable character in TPS.  IMO has the best commentary of all the playable characters.  His action skill (depending on who you ask) is a really nice addition and fits perfect with his character.  I really had fun with his red skill tree, which encourages a lot of use with multiple weapon types.  Handsome Jack red tree is similar, only his focuses around weapon manufacturers.  Claptrap is more of a support character though and soloing certain areas may get tricky.

While it's not exactly the same, but I felt that Firewatch also really went for an emotional response in some way. It also has a beautiful story to tell and an amazing art style.

Oxenfree is also kinda along the lines of LiS, so she might like that as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the voiced protagonist.

Fallout narratives consistently felt short because it was hard to feel strongly about cardboard cut outs with no range of motion.

I remember Christine in the DLC where she's been tortured horrifically and you should feel sorry for her but the fact that her speech consists of the game telling you what she's doing despite the fact you can see her stood still doing absolutely none of it...

It finally let them tell a decent story.

To finally beat him, tie him up and eat her in front of him to get revenge.

Why is the Zelda franchise the de facto hipster/gamer girl choice?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I enjoy playing games with a great story, open world games, and I also enjoy violent and dark games. tbh I think us girls play a lot of different games like guys do. 

but then what do i know? i barely talk to other people lmao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think I'm going to get her at least on RPG to try 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm on mission 3 so far and that's pretty much the impression I get. I chose to play as Emily and her far reach is just different enough from blink too make me creative. That and I'm abusing domino like there's no tomorrow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right on. It's funny how you can make people wait like that huh. The mission before the point of no return mission, I literally went grinding for different armor, because I played the entire game with the Feline set and now it has that stupid hood, of which I am NOT a fan. I was penniless and still went grinding for the entire wolf armor, dyes included, all that while the Duchess and her guard were waiting for all of us to go get that bastard.

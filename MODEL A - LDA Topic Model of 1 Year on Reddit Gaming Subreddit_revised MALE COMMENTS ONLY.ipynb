With an average retail price of $55 for November and December combined, Pachter believes the first game in a long-term licensing deal with Lucasfilm has generated approximately $660 million in revenue.\\n\\n\\n&gt;Evan Wilson, senior research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, estimates that EA sold as many as 13 million copies of Star Wars Battlefront, although he believes most of those sales came before the movie was released.'], ['Undertaker is so much younger than I imagined. In my mind he was 40 20 years ago when I was a kid. '], ['Major League Gaming, once the largest esports company in North America, is going out of business. In a special meeting on Dec. 21, MLG’s Board of Directors approved an Asset Purchase Agreement granting Activision Blizzard a large majority of MLG’s assets in exchange for $46 million.\\n\\nThe next day, a letter went out to stockholders informing them of the sale. We have included an excerpt below:\\n (re-hosted)\\n\\nIn addition to these changes, CEO Sundance DiGiovanni has been removed from his role and replaced by Greg Chisholm, MLG’s former CFO.\\n\\nThe move was done as a “corporate action taken without a stockholders’ meeting by less than unanimous written consent of our stockholders,” allowed under Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\\n\\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement was also approved by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and the Series A Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Series A Common Stock basis.”\\n\\nStockholders in this category include Treehouse Capital LLC, Ritchie Opportunistic Trading Ltd., Oak Investment Partners, and Legion Capital Investments LLC—managed by Mike Sepso, co-founder of MLG and current senior vice president of esports at Activision Blizzard.\\n\\nStockholders not in these categories are largely meeting the decision in disbelief. Some speculate that the majority of the sale will go towards paying off MLG’s debts, leaving little to go around for the remaining stockholders. MLG has filed for multiple debt financing rounds this year alone, for a sum of over $6 million. “I got fucked on stock,” said an affected stockholder, who wanted to remain anonymous.\\n\\nMLG steps down after leading the esports scene in North America for quite some time. For many years, the company successfully ran tournaments across the United States for StarCraft 2, Call of Duty, and other titles. MLG also announced that it was building an arena in China.\\n\\nHowever, MLG has also taken on recent blows, such as when rival ESL was named as the tournament runner for the Call of Duty World League.\\n\\nOnly time will tell how this move affects other MLG ventures, such as the upcoming Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championship in Columbus, OH. The only thing known for sure is that MLG, as we know it, is over.']]\n"

      "The only real similarities between Skyrim and Witcher 3 is that they are both RPGs and open-world, after that they really aren't similar.  Witcher 3 is a much more story-driven RPG, you play as a witcher named Geralt and it is his story as opposed to in Skyrim where it's made so that you kind of create your own story.  As a result, the character's feel real, they have personality and you end up actually caring about their well being.  I laughed, I cried, I got mad, the game really has it all.  It's honestly the best game I've ever played and I couldn't recommend it more.\n",

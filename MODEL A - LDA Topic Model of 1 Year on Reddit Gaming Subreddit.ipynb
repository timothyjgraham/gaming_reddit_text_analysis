      "Now some may respond by pointing out that they needed Watto to give them a part for their ship and that *that* was another reason that the pod race was necessary, but there were other solutions to that as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off there is simply the solution of force. Between two Jedi and the Queen's security forces they could have simply taken it. Perhaps this doesn't seem very 'Jedi' like, but doesn't it? If there is one thing that the prequels taught us it is that the Jedi are not above placing the greater good above all else. Moreover, they are on a mission that is essential to the security of the galaxy and Qui-Gon thinks they just found space Jesus in the form of Anakin (turns out he might not have been right, but he thought he was) so a little force doesn't seem that out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even if Qui-Gon would have been unwilling to do that there were still other solutions:\n",
      "\n",
      "He could have threatened to turn Watto in to the Galactic authorities for slavery (which again it is made clear is illegal). Something along the lines of, \"you are giving us the part, the only question is if you will be coming with us to face slavery charges, give it to us peacefully and we'll let you stay here. Make us take it from you and you'll be coming with us and tried for slaving\". The Jedi are basically a Galactic police force after all. I mean they more or less say that when Mace Windu says that they *aren't* an army but are just a peace keeping force. Here are two Jedi that are witnessing not only a crime, but a human rights violation. They should probably do something about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, they are flying the Queen's ship. I know they left in a hurry, but presumably it was pre-stocked with goods. Just look at her ridiculous wardrobe. Surely there was *something* on that ship worth bartering with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or they could have combined some of these. Perhaps they use the force to make the Queen's wardrobe look more valuable than it is to trade it for the ship part and Anakin and then also sneak his mother out at night.\n",

      "All that to say as /u/radicalation put it, the pod racing scene was awesome, but why was it necessary? Pretty much only so that we could see an awesome pod racing scene. There were so many other, better, and safer options that they could have pursued.\n",

What if quick travel between stars isn't as far fetched as it sounds, it's just that the physical laws of our simulation don't allow for it? What if our atoms are coarser than 'real' atoms, hence limiting our ability to make technologies such as nanomachines and microprocessors past a certain scale?\n",

I have no reason to believe they aren't a billion times smarter and wiser than your average human being, but I can sure as hell tell you one thing, *I would never want someone with the mind of man as I know it to be in control of reality*.

Maybe the whole point is to watch the first child born in 2045 pick their nose, and then it just shuts down? I mean, who knows if this simulation is even unique, they could have a thousand simulations running simultaneously just for the purpose of simulating random climax events and then ending all of history and starting new with a new scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line is that it's just plain terrifying to think of intelligence as we know it having any manner of control over a whole universe, because intelligence as we know it can have any number of arbitrary reasons to do  whatever it is it decides to do. The nice thing about our universe, if it is real, is that based on everything we've observed we can still predict what's going to happen, and even when. If intelligence of any kind were to have influence, who knows how it could echo throughout the universe.

I really had fun with his red skill tree, which encourages a lot of use with multiple weapon types.  Handsome Jack red tree is similar, only his focuses around weapon manufacturers.

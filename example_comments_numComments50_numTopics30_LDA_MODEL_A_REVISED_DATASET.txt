____________________ TOPIC 1 ______________________________

What shows on your screen when she has the headset on? Can you at least watch what she doing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keyboard and mouse not controller!!!!!! What are you teaching her!!!!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believe so. That's probably why she has what looks like irradiated hands. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohhhhh crap. Sorry, I thought this was r/armoredwomen. My bad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
now just get her to put down the controller and play with a keyboard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance and take off their underpants" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's good. Been trying to introduce her to some things but she has no mind for it, no imagination she says. She'd rather unwind by sitting back and watching mindless dramas. Oh well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't tell what I'm looking at. Is there something sticking out of her hand?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Holy fuck. When she hands the paper to Milo, she shows him the blank side (she turns the paper twice).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Okay, okay you found me out, my girlfriend is a chameleon!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just want her to sit on the melon for awhile, which would be my head....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't notice Shep at the bottom at first. I was about ready to sob until I saw her :')
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Life will work out buddy, don't let her go.
All the best for your future mate!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So y'all extrapolated to hell and back because you're scared of a boogeywoman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just wait til she wants to do a wax injection of her own
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't hook the ps controller to an xbox...only a woman would think you could.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she just got done murdering multiple people i think itd be normal to have shakey hands...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1. Is that a bed? 2. Why is there so much food paraphernalia in the bed?.... maybe you should've have got her a blender!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've yet to find Lana's bed, yet.

Or, where she even goes after you complete her trial...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You would all get along well with my wife most of the time she swipes my phone and clears them
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I HAVE THIS EXACT TV in my little girls room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Holy shit!]( My mind exploded as soon as she said hi
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean have you seen her Olympic spray? She's complete normal
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know! I actually got every piece but the primer to her on this very run, using the grappling hook. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what you're saying is that even after a year, she still doesn't know how to hold a controller?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how that woman turns around like "Oh! is there one over there?! Did you get it?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and here I am messing her up.  

* HER: turn left up here
* ME: turn left, right
* HER: right
* ME: wait what I am turning left, right
* HER: just fucking turn left



had to put a ring on it



welp cant format I guess
nevermind I can
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't actually see the controller in her hand.  It might not even be her playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck that. 

Oh wait it's in 2008 she may have flip flopped on that since.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How thoughtful she got you socks, for when you run out of toilet paper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she hold her controllers the same way? I can't see this being comfortable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Leave Velen they said, she will be okay they said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Have you tried giving her a keyboard and mouse so she wouldn't have to game like a savage?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I'm waiting for my wife to fucking finish up what she's doing

oh. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My stepmother is Malaysian and when she speaks on the phone to friends from home she goes full-on Just Cause 2. "Aahh, what you talkiiing-laaa?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's awesome. I give myself and my girlfriend a screen of our own, and we sit back with wireless controllers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  She could always leave the show if she wanted it bad enough.

Another woman leaving Alex would be devastating. 😪
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They have kind of the same thing in Quantum Break. You can find a girl playing Alan Wake. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never realized that the hand on his left side of his crotch is a womans
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She lets you game?!?!? 

Mine complains I ignore her and should sit in bed or on the couch watching TV with her.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd be worried, she's clearly trying to distract you from something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; When she is put down

I would do the same man...I would do the same.  Oh shit, you kept going with that sentence...I mean, yeah for bed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
doesn't she also say "honey I'm home"? I think she's saying it to meowth :O 🤔
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The room she is in looks like one of those terrorist hostage negotiation settings
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Show your wife this and tell her another wife says it is okay! Hahah
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh.

Well, I didn't know this in advance, and left her corpse in a corner of the basement. Seemed kinder at the time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you stop looking at all the girlfriend simulators a so often they should at least show up less often in your queue
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Stop thinking of little girls on the toilet then. 
You weirdo! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, you mean you actually let your little sister play video games with you?  You didn't just hand her the unplugged second controller?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then he/she turned it off before handing it over and said, "Oh, Thats too bad."

____________________ TOPIC 2 ______________________________

Most men like feminine women. I know it's hard to believe, but that's the truth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pikach-you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't have a source, but iirc this isn't actually what she said. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean if she says no then it's definitely no, but she won't say no......because of the implication. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she doesn't have a ps3 the the move won't work. I would suggest getting the Wii though, thebps3 doesn't have many motion games. Where the Wii has a lot, the Wii also has some good motion controlled games, silent hill, Mario galaxy, xenosaga.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. The guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's a reference to smash bros since she recently became a character
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe I just got tricked into watching a lemon party. I guess I should be on the lookout for tubgirl or goatse or something next.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girl likes to party all the time party all the time party all the time!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Peach has her own game and is not baking cakes :p id like to see Super Princess Peach 2 tbh.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yen is pretty much my perfect woman, had to go with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly if I married Dolce it'd be because Pico is dope AF.

Forte still best girl though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the female Krogan is only in Mass Effect 3?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It terrifies me that it looks like the choice for the next president be between her and trump. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mario has tons of girls around. Pauline, peach, daisy. The 3 of them are in one of the 3ds mii plaza puzzles together. Iirc, Pauline is still in some recent games, and was in Game boy dk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
2005 actually and even if she didn't she'd have a bit more to worry about as president should she get elected.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she flavors them sometimes. it does keep the cake moist and the flavor of the cake is still there. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except my wife did this exact same thing when she played through Mass Effect as FemShep with both female and male options. You can have sex with the male characters too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. The guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She can, trust me, she can. She's also had diarrhea at least once in her life. 

You're welcome. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you do the same thing with Mario party?  

Edit: thanks for the answers! I'll have to pick it up so me and my girlfriend can play. We love Mario party for N64 so this will be perfect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you choose her as president you're fucked Americans. Just sayin 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Naw, she hasn't even tried it. I think she's turned off my the name. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The best is in ME3 where she sees it coming and thinks she slick. Then BAM. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Saints Row and Borderlands. Something co-op because you will destroy her and you might discourage her from playing with you again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mai is seeming to be my bane, I fucking *hateeeee* Mai, and I will do anything I can to fucking destroy her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me vs the guy she tells me not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every girl has a bad ending and a good ending. Some have neutral endings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why me and my girlfriend love the Mario games on wii u
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is really good at Mario Kart but she has terrible motor skills. She has shown an interest in Smash Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. so I think I might get her started on some handheld games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's because she was a teenager, and Shepard is an adult man. Bioware doesn't approve of Statutory Rape you Pedo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you don't have to worry about whether she loves you or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her defense I find her facial expressions to be very on point for Triss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a video that is almost 10 years old and so far after that she hasn't said anything about it. Trust me you won't need to worry about it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Triss is where it's at. Always choose her over Yen myself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is what happened when I bought my wife a Wii U and Mario Party. Now she cant stop making levels and playing Mario Party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mass Effect or should I say mass erect. Amirite ladies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she didn't want anything other than votes, she just says what the people who fund her tell her to say. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or you could say she's turning into a Super Saiyan!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
obviously she was coerced by The Patriarchy^TM as women cannot make their own decisions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"at least she's not as bad as Trump"  
What a campaign slogan, I feel so good about this election.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's probably cheating on you too, if anything has been for years 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't Miranda introduced in ME2? Why would she be introducing herself in ME3? Something's fishy...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the wife playing the vive or the vive playing her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My thought too.. Mario never, not once, says she's in another castle. 

____________________ TOPIC 3 ______________________________

What makes you pretty sure? Looks like a she to me.

Not saying it definitely is, but I can't tell from that picture that it isn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol why?

there isnt anything obscene here. actually, her belly button isnt even visible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
how is lesson a verb?

how does one lesson?

how do he/she/they lesson?

whats it mean?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so she dumped you because she thought you were a nerd?  ^^jk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagine you might get downvoted for calling her a dude, yes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She gonna kill the Saviours cause she pissed that they killed Abraham. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep.
Last year, my wife added my shed/workshop to Ingress. and now she has her own personal pokestop.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree....."OK, little girl, these three buttons are used for kicking, and..."

"KO!!! PERFECT!!!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And he tried really really hard not to take her lol 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, I will ! She was quite happy to paint something different from what she was used to !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 11 I believe, her in game models for the early games were always a thing of nightmares.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah ok. Thank you for elucidating. So basically she made a career out of "outrage"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Woah woah woah she is just a little different have some respect she has feelings lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
oh, but i do like kleo, she is just my kind of girl!


(would never dare to say otherwise)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, fuck you for complimenting a girl.  How dare you call a girl pretty
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cuz I neeeheeed a woman. And I picture you with some bosoms!

Bret you got it going on!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I took a picture with her, I'd be the one with the hoverhand for once.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you wanna be the very best, like no one ever was, you gotta make some sacrifices. Like having a Pokemon hating girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's really cute if she doesn't have any missing teeth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have the best girlfriend ever and definitely keep her lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also best day to dump a girl. If she takes it well, all good. If she meltsdown, jk lol april fools.  
  
At least, that's what 6th grade me thought :/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah! I get it now, it's a Taylor Swift pun.

edit: You guys must really hate her cans!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Upvoted not because girl but because i.... dont know the rest
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Find a woman who stays in the kitchen that way you can play all the fucking games you want.  #lyfehacks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't compliment a girl on reddit without being downvoted to hell.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
oh lol i didnt realize you were a girl 

:P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, she does some hard work to make it happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Girlfriend did, but yes.
In total it took her 11 hrs of painting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't Starve Together. My fiancé doesn't like video games a whole lot, but she loves to play that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she knows how to knit and not crochet I think. And I don't understand all that much about either, so I'll ask her what she thinks. But thanks for the heads up!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh look! A selfie of a girl showing off her tits...again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Oh sweet I get to kill this bitch too."

Pretty sure she's a serial killer by that point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was both a good idea and a mistake.

It's good in that she'll approve of it

It's bad in that you're not gonna get it back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree,  you kiss girls don't you? Disgusting. Man and a woman? Fucking repulsive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
'Railing, railing, right? You wanna dump her over the railing? That's what you want, right? Oh, I get ya. Box. You wanna dump her in the box. Well, I tell you what, let's dump her over the railing.'
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Desensitizes? I'm almost tempted to agree. Causes? definitely not. He's not perfect, but he's better than her and the orange.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, you wouldn't. Since she would probably never let you near her lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a girl who games and I'm neither of those. Thanks for trying I guess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm parsing it as "PM me tits, m'lady!"

It's Neckbeard the Pirate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the idea that all men hate all women is cemented in their mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ye I definitely thought I was gonna meet her lol. Cant give a compliment on reddit without being a neckbeard
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lets all hope your girlfriend doesnt have a blacklight and trace it back to you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell, I'll take it if you don't want it. My girl loves Frozen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. Now if only I was a woman. SO makes a shit ton more lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now let's see her without all the nerd shit... her pussy :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh she's not my girlfriend she's just my bottom bitch. Do you know what I am saying 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is her name Karen irl?
*please say yes, please say yes*

Thank you for this, thank you! I didn't know about her before this. Thank you!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hope she's buckled in because it's gonna be a rollercoaster!

[Yes, The Last Of Us wouldn't have been the same if she hadn't...] (

Which could be why we didn't see his face. He was just an angel or a figment of her imagination.

It shows how far away a medic with the revive gadget is away. So you'll see it go down 1m, meaning he/she is right on top of you, and then they'll start to run away without reviving you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
According to other posters, it does appear to be chastisement, and also happens when you get very close to her chest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep that move away from female trainers. That Shiny Wailord looks like a massive dildo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
/throws flashlight at him and runs off screaming like a little girl.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This character is clearly oversexualised. You can see all her curves. So much so that she's literally round. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
wasnt that Nick? When he got the girl back he made beeping noises
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
also there is blood running down from her head (trauma?) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Normally what I do is turn towards the girl and scream, "INTERCOURSE!"

Around the third or fourth time screaming it they come around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I gotta get this game. Silent Hill 3 doesn't seem scary enough for my girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the anus on the girl on the right? Clearly she's popping out rabbit pellets.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is flying through that poor woman's chest? Crash debris?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just so happens in the 2nd game you fuck her back
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
actually if u look her video she run 90% of time. ye it was suprisingly strange to see with that build. but it works for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
bit further in that building lays a skeleton with a pen stuck in her neck
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure it'll bug the shit out of her when she notices
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can see his/her face screaming "DAMNIT, DAMNIT DAMNIT DAMNIT!!!"... Silence while firing... BLOOP! "DAMNIT!!!!" *Throws the blooper
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah man, definitely a girl's name. Right there with Serenity, Rainbow, Moonbeam, Thyme, and Rosemary.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A land down under, where women glow and men plunder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The last pane should have been him in a tree peeping into her window. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The prompt said 'open', it didn't specify the door as subject.  I argue the prompt was using the building as subject, and she opened that building right up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw a Pharah fly over a wall, send a Junkrat flying, landed and saluted as he fell past her. It was fantastic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I cant help to notice that your missing one more item...a girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tom Hardy could do a good Tommy if he had more of a roll.

I'd give Bill Paxton, well, Bill.

The woman from Silence of the lambs when she was younger would be a perfect Tess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to think he stabbed her in the neck a few seconds before the bombs dropped.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I guess that's one way to grab her jigglypuffs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine how much faster she would be if she equipped the knife.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When did Hank Hill turn into a disgruntled old woman?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same. The video was getting close to the end and i started panicking thinking she wasnt going to find it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she tells you she's wet so you bring protection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't have the heart to tell her she's missing about 600. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
gotta wander what happened on the other end, he had grabbed and yanked it down to buy time to unclip, wonder how much her face got mushed up to the doors on the other side
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why were her hearts so low in the first place...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, he did a very slight drop from where that lady is sitting. He didn't do that much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would appear so. And it is not the only area airbrushed. That, or she is sweating really badly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ciaran liked stabbing mofos with thorny daggers. So that made her a hornet I guess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
K but Mercy is not an angel she's a Valkyrie.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tear? Or just dripping blood  from the gash above her eye
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The girl is running away from something in an Oculus game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;It's like finding out that your girlfriend is a replicant.

Stop turning me on
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how one of the guys she is talking to all of a sudden just decides to run like hell. He knows that dude isn't normal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What a lucky guy. If my woman played dark souls with me, I would never not be erect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about that huge window she runs towards? If she were facing to the right just a bit more, she'd have ran right through it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dark Souls 1, just tell her to go to Burg, not to that goddamn graveyard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ever bug so far as been cosmetic only for me like ellie not having a head for 1 second, i was talking to nick and ot swtiched over to her for like one line
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how she decided to take his one possible ledge grab if falling.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
except she is a bit too perfect and the game treas her stubbornness as a good thing 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She waved at one friend, and then she waved at the other. You have to take a break in the middle so that your friends know they have each been acknowledged. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I personally just liked stabbing little girls but whatever works for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Id... Sneak up and grab her while screaming like a banshee

Rumor has it that Besy is still out there somewhere soaring into her destiny

That's the saddest part. I tried so hard to not vote for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's already in the pics above. My guess, in VI we'll find out that she pierced.

of course it was, she was always warmed up and cooled down by another guy. you were just the middle man until her next sexing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is how to make trailers. The shivers are real. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes I wish my wife gamed but she has no interest. At least you have someone 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When it's one lady and a bunch of fellas it's called polyandry. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So cool!! Did you show him/her??

Update! It let me see it!!! So cool!:) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lmao.. "my girlfriend deserves"... genuinely feel bad for this guy now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you two 13? Hurry up and just wife her already
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I wish I had a girlfriend



I wish I had a friend

____________________ TOPIC 6 ______________________________

Well, they could back in 2005 when she made that speech.

These days about 80% of retailers (give or take a few) has policies against selling M-rated games to kids, but back then it was only around 20% or so.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure it is. I have a friend that crochets. She gets offered money for stuff she makes. She gets really offended for the amount of money she is offered due to the time she has invested. Maybe if you found the right collector you could maybe get $150.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should maybe get her to buy a laser printer.  The starting ink cartridges print for 30x longer than inkjet starting catrdiges. Here's the two I've owned for many years:

Color

Xerox Phaser 6500 ($180 on Amazon, the price fluctuates wildly, but shouldn't take more than a week of looking at the price daily). 

B&amp;W only

Brother HL-L2300D ($90 on Amazon) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Acceptable? They're just selling a product, it's up to the customer to decide if the product has any value for him/her. If not, just don't get it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's been 10 years old for 15 years. He still thinks girls are icky
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not at all. Those percentages are meaningless because they include casual games, and people who play casual games are not gamers. 

The only reason those are included is because someone is trying to push an agenda. I've already covered it in another reply. the percentage of actual gamers that are women is around 10% when you take away casual games.

That's been the argument from the first day. I thought that the percentage would rise since 1998, but apparently it didn't. In 1998 the amount of female gamers was 10% and it remains 10% today. If you want to have a big say in gaming development get on the phone to all those casual game developers, but when it comes to core games, 10% doesn't entitle you to 50%. 
 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand biting her, but why did you kill her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, pretty fucked up considering they did all that to a 12 year old girl.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've checked around, and it seems so.

But I'd love to hear what they consider "gamer", and I really don't think "PC gamer" are almost 50/50. In all the people I know and played with those last few years, maybe 20% were women, and they were all 20+ years.

As you said, could be wrong though :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the fuckin' way she goes and erections, ruined the fuckin' Squanch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she'll cut of your finger and use the scanner like that. Or waterboard you until you give up the password.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that "someone" was being a dick and they decided that he or she will get a cheap sweaters instead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a girl and I know an attention seeking twat when I see one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bullshit. This is an 8 day old account. If you were such a huge gamer girl, you'd have been here for years. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have several. They mostly play MMOs.  Although, every one of them prefers being considered a "gamer" and not a "gamer girl."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Deapite spending much less money. This is probably like her husband spending a fraction of a cent on her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The cliche, "look at me, I'm a gamer" girl. I'll pass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They weren't when she made this speech back in 2005
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You did give her more money though right? You at least let her know how much it's worth and didn't just snatch it up right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gamer guys these days are so lucky.  In my day gamer girls were so rare.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll tell her that! She already sells a lot of her other work (tee shirts, pottery, paintings).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my framerates like I like my women. About 30 per second.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife makes about 45k more per year than I do. All our money goes into a joint account, we add some to savings, and spend what we want of the rest. Some months I spend more and some months she does. I agree with you that it seems silly to say "You can only spend X amount of money and the rest is mine!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is how a 50 something year old woman at my work will tell us that one of our patients have passed away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
how does that not make her a gamer? i started when i was roughly 3 years old and i'm still playing them. how can you not call her a gamer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl doesn't need to be any closer to food. All ~~she~~ it needs are a ton more chromosomes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No? We don't? We need to stop politicizing this shit and just buy the games we like and not buy the games we don't. Zoe Quinn isn't worth our time; forget her and move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would pay premium pornography prices to see her in some porno.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You say that but that's only if he paid them. I'm sure there are tons of girls who wouldn't for free.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Out of curiosity, what does your wife spend her money on?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her to sell them on Etsy.  She will have tons of orders.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yup, it's one of the few games that made my girlfriend bug me to play it! 10/10
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They weren't in 2005 when she made that speech.

Back then the ESRB rating was just a guideline for parents. There was no penalty for actually selling an M rated game to a minor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
10-15 per week is really not much at all.. if you really like it then I would have a talk with her about it being an important hobby for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that what I need to do to get a girlfriend? Cut off one of my legs?  


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely not legit in Bali, last time the girl with the herbs in surfboard bag got 10 years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can show her how many times 30 goes into 12....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[The split between men and women gamers is close to 50/50.]( Men don't make up anywhere near 80% of the gaming population.

Watch what you drill. I just spent five minutes drilling my girlfriend, and i also got a sandwich!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll be her 60 minute man. If you know what I mean ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah the video was just uploaded, but the *speech* she's giving is from 2005.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she sell prints?  I have a friend that would absolutely love this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But thats exactly it: it's only worth money because people like her got her of it. There's nothing exceptional about that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but like 80% of gamers are straight males though.. I don't even know what she's complaining about... Ohhhhh no game companies know how to market their product!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have obviously not been around a lot of 30-40 year old women that like your company.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
typical woman gamer. only idiots and women gamers build shitty like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;other gamers would pay her to play the game for them.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what a way to pay homage to a gamer, good going girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But it will cost him money and the cookies she always gives to him (and money potentially) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're specifying you're a "female gamer" chances are you either aren't or want something from people lmao

Yea she's getting asbergers very very confused with actual clinical psychopathy.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Note to self: Let girlfriend try some of your cocaine and the relationship will go well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My friend had the same happen, the first time she plays a VN she answers how she would honestly and got the alone ending
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't pass the beschell test though. Almost all her interactions are with men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not necessarily true. All we know is that she's a lawyer NOW, we don't know if she is also a vet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you want to understand the root of the dynamic between men and women, this is it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lawful evil would require her not being a criminal though
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about it is political?

The video shows a clip of the then senator(?) stating video games make kids violent and then shows evidence that she is wrong. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All you need is the VR then you can have a VR girlfriend 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah it's not directed towards her personnaly, that's what this kind of life makes you generally :/ 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She needs a Little Rascal with handicap tags and she'd be set.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Call it whatever you want, been in a relationship for almost 5 years with my girlfriend. I'm not seeking for anything. Just have respect, but it's hard to come by these days.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she threatening to measure his dick publicly if she loses?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In that sense, D.Va protecting someone also requires precision, her Matrix is her only somewhat protective ability.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. But will he be able to properly hold on to her is the *bigger* question. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
in fairness Delphox look like it could easily be female sidekicks ultimate level.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes!! I thought she was just a bimbo at first but the more interviews I watch and the more I learn about her the more enamoured I get!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In text, to my understanding, it is more proper to use 'he/she'. Whereas in normal speech, we would say 'they'.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a question, Is there any female in gaming that surpasses 1 mf in the miss fortune scale?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So women are disabled? Do you think women are incapable?

I don't go into an office and say "We need waaaaaay more blind people" so why do you such a thing with women?

Hire based on merit, which is exactly how it works now (minus Affirmative Action which is active discrimination).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; It wouldn't be a proper test chamber without it.

They're waiting for you, girlfriend.  In the *test* chamberrrr.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well yea he just killed his fucking girlfriend, of course he's gunna cry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, the question is if she'll realize and accept that or not for our case....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and specifically to look at them. You're only allowed to look at women you don't find aesthetically pleasing... to punish you for having desires.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're wife provided similar risk/effort to reward, you wouldn't be able to keep your hands off her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If my puppy has taught me anything it's that her value only increases with time.

(and that it's possible to get lost in a blanket) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
PSA: If you feel like this girl and find yourself losing to VR, or gaming, or anything else, it's not a sign of your partner having an issue. It's a sign that you're dull as fuck so step your game up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her mind a movie is passive and in a video game you actually have to do the violence. Explain to her tool use and move out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I plan on telling her to fuck off and do it herself, the results of that can't possibly be worse than trying to do it myself. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This. Having your counterpart lashing out violently and staying in a relationship with that kind of behaviour will only make you miserable. A "real" girlfriend will at worst tolerate it.

Clearly he wasn't incorporating it in the conversation if she didn't know what he was doing 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea, she did play it for a bit but said it wasn't for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She only means to dissent against anybody but her of course.

Practice. You've probably built up over 10 years of practice in navigating non-physical spaces, starting with simple ones and ending up where we are today.

For more short term tips, try a slightly higher FOV and a lower mouse speed. When you rotate too quickly it's easy to lose your frame of reference in regards to where you are, so try to make it so what when she's moving she can always keep certain on screen landmarks visible.

One might notice the distinct lack of females of the species...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One girl for 2 seconds.   
Your hormones are all over the place, aren't they?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True enough. Theres that one male that combines with the female and like melts into her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've also heard that his anaconda don't want none unless you got buns hun.....

And also.

That she may have consumed a fair amount of red beans and rice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not a press release. A press conference. I want her to answer questions from a bunch of reporters from different stations, not just the ones that want her to win.   

I want her to answer questions that  she doesn't have pre-written answers to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know it's possible the bride/groom have somewhat a sense of humor. She recognizes he likes video games and doesn't play herself so she wanted something different than just two people standing on a cake.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fair enough. I guess the low percentage of women involved in technology and science is just a reflection of their preference to follow other careers (which is kind of obvious).

The question remains though, why the preference for other areas? At least it seems an interesting topic to me. Or perhaps the other way round, why do men prefer to play these roles?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
didn't know women had anything to do with science so it confused me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So my partner just called me/us (those playing PGO) sad after watching thebvideo. I quickly corrected her, we are now the majority and she is the minority, she is the sad one.

He is not saying that Pontiff is the quickest Bossfight in general. He means in her Speedruns the Pontiff takes the least time, that's why it's used for gifs. She also does him Blind from time to time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She cannot be this idiotic....aren't they already regulated? you have to be a certain age based on a games rating right? and what will she do of video game piracy? id also love to see sources for her claims.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you would never notice that if she wasn't in a strange position,not in a million years 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
looks like she had to carry the source for her reference around so she could explain what she was
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should probably drop the "tbf" considering you're not being fair at all. 

And just for people to note, this is a /r/circlebroke user so take what he/she says with a handful of salt since it's almost definitely biased circlejerk.

____________________ TOPIC 8 ______________________________

Females no, but the main aspect of Lara Croft is her breast size. You can't disagree with that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sausage pinkey, it's fucking as big as the rest of her fingers. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Original Lara was so much better - look how perky her tits are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do you mean by just right? I would say that she is fat and not just a little and it is not healthy to be that big
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it weren't for make-up, Asian women would have a really hard time getting boyfriends.

This girl doesn't really have any make-up on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always thought that Claudia Black would be a good Yennefer, and she's played similar characters before (eg. Morrigan)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those breasts would really hinder that women and just ruin her back. Breasts are bigger than her waist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm really into cookware. 

Although some people also use it to mean attracted to people of all genders. Man, woman, trans, etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I stopped being attracted to video games and started talking to real women. Because you know, you can actually do things with them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was also nice how the other people weren't shoehorned in **because** they were black/female/asian, etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No it doesent... She looks like she has a normal amount of muscle and quite a lot of fat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess. It'd be better if she actually had breasts
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well my girlfriends tits aren't that sharp and pointy so what am I supposed to do eh? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Perhaps, except a D-cup is smaller than you think, especially on a small frame girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then before he stops he says "Byee" to her in his classic tone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right?  I would be SO stoked if I found one.

If you're having a bad day, little things like this can make a huge difference.   What she's doing is wonderful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rufus is like.... no... her tits are THIS big :(.......
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lara Croft?  She looks likes an average hippy girl three days into a festival to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just still your gender but gay, you'd probably put your sperm into a woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She wasn't a big fan of Captain Toad. She liked to watch, but not really play that game.

I'm going to have to be on the lookout for that Kirby game. She pretty much only plays on the gamepad as it is, so she will likely love it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;How big is too big?

Ask my girlfirend ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now she looks like every other gamer's Lara Croft action figure under a black light. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, I'm a straight girl and all I can see is titties.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Around the last time I heard someone going on about how attractive Tracer is.

Tracer doesn't have ridiculous sized tits like Kratos does muscles, so I think someone like Nathan Drake from Uncharted or Joel from Last of Us would be better a better example of females finding a well toned and muscular male character attractive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman and I'm pretty sure Joker and Harley still count as Batman villains.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What you never seen a woman with a penis before?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right... and even if it wasn't... like you still need a male and female...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apparently she was pretty or had some pretty large physical features
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't understand why straight men like to see attractive women in revealing clothing?

That is a tough one...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is, she looks a bit different in rise of the tomb raider. I think it's an old image
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yup...straight men should really stop being so attracted to the representation of women and women in real life.  It's so icky!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she the bit with one tit bigger than the other?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goddammit Glady!! You made this whole montage of making a better cup noodle cup out of cup noodles
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What should we call this game about a lady who raid tombs?
Tomb raider.
What about the sequels?
Tomb raider.
But we...
TOMB. RAIDER.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're about to become female? Congrats. That takes a lot of courage. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am one of those women. That's why I'm confused about her voluptuous breasts and teensy nips.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, the first game with female as leading role is the game of life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
congrats now you know how the rest of us feel when they cast a Scot to play an Egyptian and cast a white girl to play a Japanese person...This is where you get the answer the rest of us minorities get...get over it. 


Feel better Now? No, I know you don't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This game is badassssss. What is it yo?
This is a game that this girl would play
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My point is not to refute the point entirely. My point is that it's hardly fair to say 'male athletes are conventionally attractive and female athletes aren't'. There are more than a few counterexamples. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Tomb Raider reboot Lara Croft is the sexiest looking char I've ever seen in video games. 

The sequel Rise of the Tomb Raider Lara doesn't look as alluring and sexy. Looks more like a run of the mill middle aged woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how tired she is of tomb raider jokes?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like when one is slightly larger than the other... and on her back. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does a MacGuffin.

Just because her role is important doesn't make it substantial or representative or even a protagonist's role.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't mind being flashed in real life, but she'd have to be fairly attractive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That big girl is looking to get hitched with that short guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I think someone like Nathan Drake from Uncharted or Joel from Last of Us would be better a better example of females finding a well toned and muscular male character attractive.

Because they're proportioned like real life men and have pretty faces.

That still doesn't mean any shirtless meatmountain is eyecandy for female players.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I get what you mean! As Lara Croft, she's strong, but as Joe, she lets people tell her what anything. This means she can play many characters :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've always loved Lara Croft because of her great big... personality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I wouldn't go so far as to call her a slut just for showing a bit of midriff.

____________________ TOPIC 9 ______________________________

Please stay on topic. You're not wrong, and I don't disagree with you, but it's not helpful to just keep redirecting to whatever issue you disagree with her on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know, I would have been completely fine if they never mentioned at all that they were twins. I mean even then, that could be a cute nickname they give each other because they clearly aren't twins.

But then what did they go and do? Have dialogue where your character mentions being in the womb with her. For fuck sake.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen the *complete* opposite. 

What games are you talking about where women get nastily targeted and harassed so badly? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I'm one of "her rabble".

[Which one are you?](

&gt; I never said there were no idiot feminists. I take issue with being held accountable with people I disagree with.

you're the one in their club, not me. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sorry I can't make a judgement call unless I can see how impractical her boobs are.

FTFY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but she did use water according to her so she more than likely didn't use the product correctly and thus had the issues with it. thats just a logical conclusion to come to. however, if you wanna act like it's the proof of all proofs that she doesn't make her own cosplay well who am i to make you believe otherwise.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is literally the dumbest argument that the internet has ever produced.

edit:Are people really using a gay indie game as justification in a zero-sum argument that female objectification is alright because of male butt pictures, of which only a few could even reasonably be qualifed as "male objectification". Don't people realize that sexuality and objectification isn't necessarily bad but it's the frequency and degree that women get objectified that's the actual problem?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
its quite obvious she thinks its because of her gender, girls are always like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol ok. Whatever you need to tell yourself. She is easily that worst D candidate of my entire lifetime and it has zero to do with her vagina.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just specifically said she wasn't op. My argument is that she's too overall perfect. According to you her downside is to be completely out numbered. That's a pretty shit downside. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are absolutely correct.  You may love her but she wants all of your time in exchange.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same logic applies to a team.

If the team that made this is happy with it, good.

Are people saying that a woman should've told them to change it along the way?

Why?

It's not better changed. It's just different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
to be fair, the internet did act completely stupidly and start sending threats and insults. Tht did nothing but help her 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Feminist != female; MRA != male

No, it means we aren't in a subreddit that falls for the "everything is sexist and racist!" garbage. It isn't racist to say something that's true. Saying "It's harder for black people to get sunburn" isn't racist, it's just a fact, just like saying "women generally to take more selfies than men in current society" is just a fact. Stereotypes are usually exaggerated, but they don't come about for no reason. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so when it comes to gaming bullies we only care about females?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Feminists dont complain why there are very few female carpenters, coal miners, construction workers, etc. Everyone is a Feminist until they need something done right.

They can, but the older you get the less likely you are to change your mind about things. Also, unless there is something new that conflicts with what she said then, then this is the closest we have to her opinion. She COULD have changed her mind, but without evidence it's more reasonable to think she is still thinking the same way than to assume she has changed her mind.

What women? I actually know a lot of women who are in the industry. My mom is, my gf is, and a lot of my friends are girls. So what's your actual proof besides just reading some bullshit article by Anita?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am no longer surprised how so many folks believe Trump is a racist and misogynist regardless of how many women and minorities he puts in leadership positions.  

It makes me realize how super easy he will steamroll into 2020.
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Denial is not an argument. And it's all the same, you've just got internalised misogyny. It doesn't matter if you're female, if you hate the female form, you're a bigot, period.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she will vote hard with the current fad of politics until it's not? I don't know if that's a good thing either though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But what if I don't agree to my assigned gender but want to identify as something other than male or female. Is that not transgender? 

Edit: This was a serious question
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Maybe she wants to focus on media criticism instead of making games?

Then at what point do we stop trying to cater to people who don't want to even be there?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 if she's even dumb enough to think that in the first place, i doubt she will change much. 


bring up her hobbies and interests if you want to actually argue that you should be allowed to have you own

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They don't objectify women. They don't objectify men either. The whole "objectification" argument is stupid. For starters, the idea that a female character's attractiveness to men somehow devalues her character is sexist as hell. It's fundamentally no different from religions that say women have to stay covered up to avoid sinning in some way. Secondly, it's acting like one subjective interpretation (read: finding the character physically appealing) is the only one that matters, and the art itself has to be censored around that interpretation. Art is not subject to your moral grandstanding because someone else finding it appealing offends you.

Have you ever watched 'Real Time' with Bill Maher or any Fox News debate?

Being female isn't the root of the problem, I'd suggest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is insane, likes her guns, and likes killing things.  

"Rules are meant to be broken, like buildings, and people!"

So, yes.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't blame my completely perfect candidate for her failings, fuck you! /s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; When you assumed that because I wasn't a feminist, I must be an evil penis-bearing man. Remember?

absolutely inductive reasoning on your part

&gt;I did. Your counter-argument was that pay rates didn't matter when comparing income. It was crap. Doesn't even need to be addressed.

absolutely a straw man argument on your part. if you had read it at all, no. that's not at all what my argument was, exactly the contrary

the next uhhh 3 paragraphs? are all ad hominem 

anyway, this is really just an argument about 3d cartoon girl buttcracks and creative decisions by blizzard in the first place

i congratulate you for donating to causes to stop female human trafficking. but again, just because there are worse problems in other places doesn't mean we shouldn't care about problems we have here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm mocking the trend of how girls now stand by pointing out how exaggerated her posture is. Bro. lol. And there I mocked you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, and I'm familiar with the argument, having used it before. Perspectives change, people change. 

Note that I didn't say "grow up," I'm not pointing out that anyone is wrong. Who knows who's got the better perspective on reality or even if a 'better' judgement is valid - I was reading an article the other month about neurological changes that happen on parenthood, I may now just be distorted. 

At the same time, I have some empathy towards that girl and her mother; needless, sure, but there nonetheless, and it bothers me that it takes so long for humanity to build that empathy. 

So, who knows what's the better perspective.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They absolutely don't work like most women think they do, I can tell you that for a fact.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; However, gender relations are horrible.

Yes, they're clearly terrible, wherein the past, women were absolutely treated as equals to men!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So is this still her stance, or just political gamesmanship from the past?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i don't understand, what were you trying to prove to her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How do you know that? I did leave her and didn't see anything to suggest that. Also, even if that's true, there's no way you could know that at the time of deciding it, so it's not unforgivable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
AH, you say all these problems exist in Saudi Arabia, and they do, but then WHY THE FUCK ARE THE FEMINISTS CRYING ABOUT WOMEN'S BUTS IN VIDEOGAMES INSTEAD OF RALLYING AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT 9YO GIRLS GETTING RAPED IN SAUDI ARABIA?  
  
Oh I know, because the majority of them aren't doing it to actually help people, but to make themselves feel good, so they create imaginary problem they can complain about and feel good about it.  
  
In the US, what rights do men have that women don't? None.  
  
Also if feminists are so for "equality, why do they constantly shut down men's shelters? Heck a group of them even brought the guy that started on to fucking suicide because of their harassing and death threats. Also, if these feminists aren't "real" feminists, why do the "real" feminists let them do what they do silently, without ever calling them out for it?  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is this with 'you people' and assuming I have had no negative life experiences? You've constructed who you think I am in your head and are arguing with that. You have no idea of what situations I have dealt with in my life. Just because I can see beyond them doesn't mean they don't exist. 

Once again you have simply reiterated that these things happen to men too. Which I already agreed is true. All I am pointing out is that it is an issue that's bigger for women. 

I would urge you have to conversations with women in your life. Honest unbiased conversations. Because it is through my sisters, mother and female friends that I have been able to better understand the different issues men and women face. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I'm supporting the notion of true equality based feminism that I've seen in action around my community.

Ok, I'll bite. What rights do men have that women don't?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've provided pure facts. If you refuse to listen, that makes YOU the ignorant one. And I think you should look up what [fascism]( is. You've been given the truth, and refuse to open your damn eyes. Whatever, go vote for the woman who called blacks "super predators", who voted to go to Iraq, who has repeatedly discriminated against the black community, and said that we must ["bring the blacks to heel"]( And you still haven't provided ANY evidence to prove your claim of Trump being a racist. Who's the ignorant one now, hmm?

Dammit sysiphus 

But as a person who hates admitting when she's wrong, fairnuff
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But how can you say that it does not have any impacts? I was talking about Anita Sarkeesian and her SJW team, who made those complaints about TW3. She even could speak at the UN, how can you say that they don't influence the developer/executives etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a big part of her life's work/ legacy. Nothing wrong with acknowledging it en memoriam.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you.

 I didn't want to reply to her,  but my comment about the triforce has nothing to do with gender, and certainly isn't to call the person a fake.  I just disagree with OPs statement. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have played this exact game, in fact my girlfriend thought this was me 

AMA
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They will complain that she is too capable like the morons did with Rey when they tried to claim TFA sucked. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
See, OP shouldn't be mad at them for this... Blizzard is really good about allowing the community to have some control over what happens to their games (with exceptions) and this is just a case of them thinking that this woman held a popular opinion in the community, (there probably are more people than just her who feel that Tracer is over sexualized) and when they realized that her opinion was not so popular, they decided to revert the change.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's her name?


sorry, wrong comment section. I thought this was pornhub
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hate bad grammar and people that insinuate that any criticism of anything involving women is sexism.

____________________ TOPIC 10 ______________________________

That swimsuit drawing a while back showed she had some hidden titties.

Boobs.  What more can a guy ask for?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But is a copyrighted work someone's property? Is someone entitled to the economic value of his or her creative efforts? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because attractive half naked women make literally every single thing better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because men are rarely sexualized. Lots of people don't understand the difference between characters being attractive and characters being sexualized. There are plenty of male characters that are attractive, but they are rarely designed with the intention of appealing to female/gay sexuality. People finding these characters sexy is different from them being designed with sex appeal in mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is a crime that this doesn't have more upvotes. Just because he isn't a sexy half naked girl doesn't mean he shouldn't get respect....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This makes me so mad I'm going to go have sex with my girlfriend so I'm not so mad anymore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should be happy. Does she know how rare snorlaxes are?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can appreciate that they're nice, but I don't feel a sexual attraction toward her.  :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her defense, Trevor is usually covered in dirt or shit 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that's literally her whole design. Without it, who even is she? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're a dude, he's a dude, she's a dude, WE'RE ALL DUDES 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Nothing like giving a dude a handy before molesting his girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh no, men like seeing attractive women in sexual situations. Someone rally up some women and start shaming everyone here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who are those people? I know neither the women nor the game characters.

As for iconic, I'd say Kirk and Spock or Holmes and Watson are more iconic by a longshot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm confused.  It seems like most (if not all...?) of these are a video of "a dev" playing "a game" and not really "the dev" playing a game he/she worked on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I agree with that wholeheartedly, but as a personal taste, I find her sex appeal cringey. I'm not saying they shouldn't have done it, or that she shouldn't be a character but it's not for me. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I normally create a female character first, and then a male character. There's a lot of reasons, but the first is usually that most games that let you make a character always use a guy in the advertisements, and it's the first thing I can do to make the game feel like my own.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
By the look in her eyes, if this relationship was on the rocks, this was the moment when she rekindled her romance for him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well we now know who's never seen a girl naked before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She would be great to have sex with, she wouldn't talk afterwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't understand how being sexy is out of character for Tracer. Are all wacky and "spunky" girls supposed to be  ugly tomboys? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I came here to say this. There is nothing wrong with being sexy, just make female characters more than sexy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And just like other girls she's not allowed to have sexuality. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All the women look like they were designed by a horny teenager.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh no! A different but still totally legitimate personal preference! Nothing wrong with her feeling that way, I'll probably get crucified for saying it too but it's not even in my top 3 Kanye albums.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh wow a real Futa. Tell me, do you enjoy having sex with normal woman or other futas?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Along with the fact that she's not attracted to you sexually
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They couldnt ply it because Bayonetta is a woman and women aren't allowed to have sex appeal or sexuality because it exploits all women and/or it makes insecure women feel bad about themselves. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ahh thought there was someone hiding behind her. Awesome present :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude it's okay, most of us don't have girlfriends either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand the turf is verdant, and the females rather attractive 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She probably got it to cover up her scar where she was bitten
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she does it, it's okay. When I do it, it's "sexual assualt"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a difference between dudes drawing dudes for hetro dudes to look at, and dudes drawing women for hetro dudes to look at.

There are PLENTY of people that try to shame any woman using a sex toy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always view chuck under the sheets, hiding with that girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would be gross watching Mads romance women a fraction of his age
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is it that androgynous male characters are always more attractive than female characters?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not really. She's obviously designed to be attractive and sexualized. It's obvious people would find her hot. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't even have to be particularly good at games if you're a reasonably attractive female
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are plenty of attractive girls who like geeks.  Don't fret just because one shallow girl doesn't.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  the women look like eye candy.

Like women want to look? What kind of percentage of the women want to look like Brienne of Tarth? Not the feminine majority, I'll tell you that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; When is okay to sexualize women being sexy

Always.

&gt; when am I a jerk for noticing?

never
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Well of course it's sexual. I'm just saying that Capcom didn't go "cyaor let's have her sexy arse out for no reason".

nobody said that!!1!!11
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who fucking cares?  Have you not seen most female characters in games?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really, I just killed her. If she's that stubborn, oh well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I suppose I am wrong but I was saying it on the context of women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, that Forsaken ad is just a naked lady. Not even trying to cover it up.

(which is fine by me)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she mad about your gaming too much, or is that just a nerdy pun?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she realized it or not, it certainly didn't need to be rubbed in. Dude is no better than Dylan

____________________ TOPIC 11 ______________________________

My girlfriend just spent $500 on a new iPhone today because her iPhone 5C couldn't handle PokemonGo. Money well spent. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FWIW, I play on the highways. Besides, my girlfriend's car gets better mileage, and she doesn't mind driving. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I usually just steal my gfs phone when she's around, download it and play myself from her phone. Then later delete the app if it's not needed any more for future use
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like this idea. The reason she takes everything in her stride the whole game is because she's tripping balls on painkillers and/or delirious from sepsis the whole time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How long did it take her (hours)?  This was an incredible challenge.  Awesome work!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was a lone witcher anyways.  But, good advice. I fucked Kiera then killed her so there's that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh, crazy can fuck. Plus, you know she'll help you rob a bank. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We made the deal of I handle the honeymoon completely and she handles the wedding - it worked fairly well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm very aware, but I know myself too well and I'd end up putting my shit in her PC and getting myself all new stuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife has the same disease and we can both sympathise with both of you. 

As someone else said, a 3DS with some games that really interest her would keep her entertained and hopefully help her feel better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But virus != broken pc. Her brothers will have to help her fix it(or she fixes it by herself with the help of Google) and she'll learn from it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's wonderful. Started watching her channel a while ago and it has helped me notice things in my own play throughs that I would've never appreciated before. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apparently not enough to understand what women can actually look like.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FF13 was so bad she had to take another job. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope she won something. She looks like she stepped off the screen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Except the loading screen girl looks more like Yvonne Strahovski...](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get your own Xbox stop mooching your girlfriends games and Internet.

Dammit where was that girl when I was interning at my first computer repair job.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
anything really, she has a chromebook so she cant really download anything
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've got this one dude name Vincent Armstrong who's job is essentially running the radio station and impregnating all the women who work with him. I strive to be like Vince one day...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's sad and simple. These men are sexually frustrated and through a level of anonymity they feel entitled to release that frustration on every woman they run across online. I'm sorry you have to deal with their shit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well to be fair, I don't know much about her. But I'll switch love with like if it helps you out, man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She'd also like you to think she's not a baby eater. But she's never gone on record saying she isn't! Maybe she's too busy EATING BABIES.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact she played it for so long while being recorded shows she's pretty nerdy herself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Second definition]( This is "miss" as in "I miss my wife when she goes on long business trips."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's fucking sick and I'm proud she did it so well!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless she sees it, then it won't matter how much you spent because "you just did it for yourself".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely is. Just yesterday, I was about to take it, and she starts going for it. I was going to just drive off and have her watch, but got in on the passenger side, while she got in the other side. She drove me around for a while, but I had to stop before I could see where she ends up. :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's my one and only. So she got the pc I built in 2009 when I built a new one a year or so ago.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She loved [anything with a screen on it]( If I had to clean her home or something I'd put her in front of a tv or my laptop to watch videos of bugs, although she seemed to like non-bug videos too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, at least you know he/she was not playing the entire hour, as the battery's won't last.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn,  she drives just like every regular everyday girl.  Plus drives like my wife! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She probably be the billionth person doing it at whatever is the next thing she goes to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then what's the issue? If she's on board with it, you should be talking to her, not us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend doesn't realize her telling me she's going to delete the game from my phone are empty threats.  :)  I'll let her think she has the power.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She sure as fu k better not plan on coming to Canada.  We don't want her here....or on tv....or anywhere really.  Basically she should just go away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she's probably right...
if i wasn't addicted to that game I wouldn't play it either. Really frustrating stuff sometimes...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the screen is screwed in and I throw a pillow in the case as well, no big deal if it does get smashes, way she goes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's built like a steakhouse but she handles like a bistro.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get a girlfriend. She will handle your time management for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I keep her in a cabinet and dust her off once a week!" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks perfect as it is! :D how long has he/she spent on it so far?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Letting her waste a whole year's of work because she doesn't know how video games and computers work is not good advice at all. All that's going to happen is that she'll be very upset that all her work was ruined because of something she had no way of knowing.

Letting her ruin a year of work because some dumbfuck idea that she has to "learn that not everything goes your way" is not a good idea. You don't teach that stuff by watching her cry as her one year project is flushed down the toilet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Deleted because you don't deserve to see anymore.

My girlfriend. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or maybe he doesn't want to fuck her and they are friends. do you have any friends? do you know how they work?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She also lost Ohio, WI and MI. and gets California, New York, Oregon and Washington for essentially free because she has  D next to her name. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's the same day I watched my friend throw her remote at and through her big screen TV because Timberlake lost some award or something on the MTV awards we were all watching lmao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You couldn't just ask her? You know like show interest in a hobby of hers...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't matter. Between now and in 60 years she won't age in the game. Release date works. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So was my wife, and I warned her before she started the download. 

That was a waste of perfectly good bandwidth.

Data usage would be very low, and IP-6 lets us have 3.4×10^38 unique addresses. We can waste some of them on lightbulbs. 

That's 3,400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses, or enough for every man, woman and child on Earth to have 480,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 unique internet-accessing devices each.

I know it was only a joke, but I really wanted to write out the giant numbers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This always happens to me. I'm surfing the net looking at the news and safe for work stuff, and when someone walks by a banner pops up with a big tittied girl saying "Meet local girls in your area"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or if you're female soak a tampon in alcohol and go to town 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's pretty bad. You can venture off the course to surrounding areas but it's literally just follow this girl around the whole time 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No because then she'll think you aren't a man as stipulated in the appendix to rule #0102
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because men and women are different biologically, men are better in several area's, where women are better in different area's.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
With all the single women in your area wanting to meet you, I'm not surprised

Unit Forn, all-female unit pre-Yavin. Cadets, but established precedent that there were female troopers.

The online gaming world is full of assholes. There is a contingent that harasses everyone. If you weren't female they'd harass you for something else.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The girl?  You mean Elyse Willems, she's actually pretty knowledgable about games believe it or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this a thing with women too? I've gotten really drunk before but I've never peed in anything. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her username on Twitch is SayviTV, she's actually streaming right now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's women all over the planet. Have you tried looking for them instead? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she bring it down to the basement for you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because I'm allergic to cats, I had to allow two human girls to join my group...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She streams regularly on Twitch, her username is SayviTV :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Being her father is the Senate Minority Leader... I don't think she's going to leave any time soon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You must live alone. If my significant other wanted to keep that she'd be single.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried to find a video of her playing guild wars and the results were [unfappable] ( Vote Maria Ozawa!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen guys donate more than that to female streamers. And I'm not talking about those camgirl ones. I'm talking about girl streamers that play video games on Twitch. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After living for 11,000 years, she probably doesn't give two fucks anymore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Little does she know he's been having an affair and has a mistress and an entire secret family in Stardew Valley. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She hired a guy to follow her with a large mirror.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've known small women, and I've not a small man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even creepier that he's been living in her basement without her knowledge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The look jen had on her face when she orders her drinks and turns around and sees that it's Moss bar tending is so great. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She needs a world map, so donators can help her travel places
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You play Pokemon and got a girl like that to talk to you? Well played, I must know your secrets
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know this will eventually lead to her moving out and joining a nudist colony
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And Lea still thinks she's dating the biggest streamer on Twitch ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I play with my girlfriend this is how it works, except I get my diamond pickaxe because I *need* it for obsidian.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pokemon Ho had me earn badges in very different ways. Misty lives up to her name though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would fucking gut me worse than if she killed him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually got in an accident today, right next to a fire truck luckily. The girl was playing Pokemon go. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except she actually won and the losing side is salty
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But it's still a problem if the field is *perceived* as unwelcoming from the outside because women won't attempt to get into the field in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A web search for "Times I was there for her when you weren't" returned 29 results.

I live in Texas too, my girlfriend and I just decided to do other shit during the daytime, and when it gets darker go out and catch some pokemon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've known this person for several years, and she's legitimately a more tolerant, nicer person than I am. It baffles me how a person could abandon a daughter like that.

(Say hi to her, guys - she's pretty new here! :D)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeeeaah... that happens to everyone. Everyone tries to roast everyone in communities like CS:GO, and they try to find ways to shit on you, and since you're a female, which is a minority in the gaming community, they'll use that a lot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Especially when she forces you to join the doot army
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, he was like whatshisface in American Pie, joining the choir group for chicks.

Pretty great how we're all about privacy until we get a chance to make women to show us more than they were willing to in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After 200 or more (I've stopped counting) attempts of her never missing, I've concluded that is not how it works.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, I don't know if it's just me, but simply *knowing* that it's procedurally generated is a turn off for me. Even if they managed to procedurally generate a convincing city, I'd rather they not tell me that it was procedurally generated. It's like finding out that your girlfriend is a replicant.

[For those that never saw the original post of this]( it's pretty great.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The person she is tributing who did the pictures originally was a guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I doubt OP is being a karma whore, he/she has been a redditor for 5 years and barely has any karma.  Likely just genuinely excited about the find.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1. Be a girl
2. Get a game-related tatooo
3. Post picture to reddit
4. ?????
5. Profit!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I showed her that I posted her drawing on reddit. 
She sent me a screenshot of your comment and said "yes please" as the caption. Thank you, distant wingman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can confirm, am girl and love video games 

^give ^^me ^^^attention ^^^^pls  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just don't climax at the exact same time she does....she's not going to let you throw her off
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here is her Instagram, best I can do for you.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you saw their girlfriends, you would not feel bad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's exactly what i thought! although according to another thread, [Spoiler](/s "you don't meet her regardless")
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you have a cat? My mom does puzzles and her cats steal one piece every puzzle. They know what they're doing because it always just one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This fucking sub.

If Clinton talks out against video games, she's Satan's wife, but if Sanders does, it's fine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has done one actually, pretty sure someone linked her Instagram and some imgur galleries with it farther up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she would at least understand its a reference to soemthing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In reference to the title only, though she is rather reptilian
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Daisy x Luigi has never been a real thing in the games. WHY do people keep assuming they're a thing? Mario was the only one to ever rescue her anyway.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why do people on this sub reddit get so butthurt when a girl is involved, regardless of the title it's a good and relevant post
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
do i look like i give a heck?

edit: do u count ninja edits?

edit 2: omg please stop PMing pictures of the back of your throat

edit 3: that girl was into you, you should've asked her out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are you posting that on the internet? Call her and tell her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Welcome to Reddit, where assuming every woman is an attention whore is reasonable, but assuming every douche that calls them that is a jackass isn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It'd be awesome as a gif so I can see her lick
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How does she have 705 link karma and 0 submissions?

Private subs?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Title is "I have the best wife ever." 

&gt; This poster says "Is she single." 

BOI. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the fuck is this? Like, even my GoT subreddits and my TiA are full of this shit.

Who caused this? I am going to punch him/her in the cock/vag
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good point. It was mostly just a dig and the recent rig we saw in the gif that hit the front page of female pathfinder Derping out 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just as a follow up - this subreddit is kind of the real yeah I'm serious.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP want's the internet to say, they'd fuck his girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A fiancée is a woman by the way. 

Fiancé is a man. 

Edit: For all the people who are getting on to me for assuming that she is marrying a man: I didn't. OP referred to her fiancé as a "he" elsewhere in the post, so I confirmed that before making my post. I assumed nothing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, she's very obese.  My point was that I don't think that's what OP was meaning in the title.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am genuinely curious as to why he/she said "really?" to that comment.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hello my lady, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aww she saw something on reddit and said "me too!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The top post literally says "men", and there are lots of comments about it in this thread. Including comments saying a woman doing this would be "motherly".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey op, so your girlfriend is Elise Laurenne? I saw that on her Instagram. Pretty awesome work man! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like there are two guys on the internet, one that plays the straight man and another with witty comebacks. Maybe three if you take into account the girl that always wants you to like her page.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't have to be a stormtrooper to miss her, I've just seen the front page
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a different screenshot showing the persons name but wasn't trying to put he or she on blast on Reddit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I saw this picture and title I was thinking "girlfriend/wife, right?" I guess I was right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure looks like she moved it when OP was taking the picture.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"What if Zelda was a girl" Zelda is a girl, you used an image of link.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know! You'd think OP could've gotten all that extra karma and cleared up all that confusion if he/she had just put the name in the title to begin with!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believed this until I saw there was a girl there. Clearly the signs were added before or after and this was really a GoT fanclub meeting. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How did OP post this and not the girl who got gifted?

You stole her Santa karma OP, you dirty Grinch karma whore!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I squealed like a little girl when I saw Donner.  I'll definitely be following this game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She got (1 year+ ago) the negative karma from all subs she posted in
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They only reference him as a boy because in that specific timeline he is. If he reincarnates as a girl in one game then they call him a her instead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Link is a dude.  So at best that's Zelda dressed as Link.  The Caption asks *What if Zelda was a girl?* but Zelda already is a girl, Zelda is the princess.  So they Confused Link with Zelda, drew Link as a girl, then posed the question *what if Zelda was a girl?* when it looks like they meant *What if Link was a girl?* 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, it isn't a girl's account posting this, just a guy going for karma FYI
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
there are women out there who like gaming. Mine doesn't, but op's might :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good fucking god you guys are brutal to people sharing their creation. "Karma whore" 

She said that she just started posting stuff man. Karma doesn't even do anything!

____________________ TOPIC 14 ______________________________

I was fighting Reach Frogs outside of Narshe (WoR) and tried to Sketch one and it went all glitchy. Terra now has a Fenix Down as her weapon and my inventory is all messed up 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hook only does 30 damage and Mercy has 200 health. It'd take 7 hooks to kill her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Her personality during the final battle is the same as usual

That's not even slightly true. Go play it. She acts just as proper and ladylike as ever.

She fights, but her personality and character are still gone to shit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More importantly, remember when Kat died... and you got to fly a fucking Pelican! That was a great level, completely over showed her death. Also, lets.have a moment of silence for the brave men and women, such as myself, who beat Reach LASO
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In fairness, she didn't miscarry because the baron attacked her. His attacking her made her want to miscarry so she asked the Crones who obliged and turned the baby into a botchling!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her right click icicles are super deadly in the hands of a good player. Makes her much worse if she can hit you with those from mid range and freeze you at close range.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it is, it's mostly for the chainsaw gun. she likes running around with it revved. You should see how many times i have to revive her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, she falls in the exact same place relative to her mech every time. A good player playing a Junkrat or Widowmaker should be able to destroy her instantly.

Also, Reinhardt is good, pin the mech to a wall, then hammer her twice and she's dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look from her perspective, she sees the red flash of his arrow almost directly in front of her. Take that, then arrow drop, and it's obvious that the arrow dropped into her slightly extended head hitbox above her. It is certainly extended, i just think people exaggerate it. Plus, as i said before, Hanzo hitting any shots at range on targets moving erratically, especially headshots, take either a lot of luck/spam or a lot of skill regardless of the extended hitbox. Any hanzo, with good enough K/D and an accuracy &gt;20-25% is a good hanzo in my book.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also she finds a WWII-era submachine gun and manages to turn it into an AK-47.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought Qualaag was the easiest, myself. She tells you exactly what she is doing at all times and has such an easy pattern. Gaping Dragon was so tough for me because of he hits so hard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The sergeant running the grenade range slammed it against a metal siding in an attempt to get her to release it. It takes like 1-3mm of play after you depress the spoon and pull the pin to activate the fuse. Drop the shit or throw it or we'll make you drop it they said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is. I was fucked UP....The pretty girls had never looked at me my entire life, then all of a sudden they did. I couldn't handle it.

Don't sweat the pretty girls fam. 9/10 are completely useless.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've hooked a D.Va off the objective while she was activating her ultimate but ended up pulling in the mech while she ejected mid pull. Things can go bad real quick, and that's what I love about this game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She missed it on her way tumbling down the mountain and flying across the chasm to get there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Squirrel girl is a joke character who's thing is that she beats everyone she's up against no matter how strong they are. She'd probably beat Goku too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, I tried that last night and got stopped in the second forest becuase two hordes ran at me.  Otherwise I found it relatively easy.  Any tips? I level up explosive shot, the healing spell, and my gun for VH.  Then for katarina I used her to increase my attack speed and armor along with making her a tank (which fails with how often she gets killed in newer areas)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try being a winston player and shield bubbling her mech at the last second before it blows up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Take your time to level yourself up a little bit if you're having trouble, make sure to use the blacksmith to upgrade your weapons so you can damage them more easily.

An important thing to do is just pick a gargoyle and keep targeting him. If memory serves, one is more physical and the other is more fire breath. The second spawns once the first has got roughly half health, but i believe he also spawns with less health overall, so it doesn't really matter which you decide to kill.

Other than that, the best advice i can give you for pretty much any boss in Dark Souls is to completely give up trying to attack them. Instead dodge, and watch. Every time they attack, watch how they behave, what their tells are, dodge and run away. 

Don't make the battle into a battle for beating them. Make it a point to try to survive as long as you can. Because that will mean you will understand them, and when you see them move you will know what they are doing.

Doing that is how you defeat Dark Souls. It's why i died to the Bell Gargoyles like ten times when i first played, and yet defeated them first try when i replayed the game years later. Even though i hadn't played in years, i still remembered their tells. 

Case in point. For me, Quelaag Daughter of Chaos was a really difficult fight because she had a bullshit AOE blast attack that seemed to come out of nowhere when i was fighting her and one-shot me. 

It was only once i recognized that her body goes slightly limp just before she does it that i was able to defeat her. Knowing that i watched her like a hawk, and dodge rolled away like fuck whenever she did it.

Defeated her the very next time i faced her.

There's bosses later on for whom not doing this will basically get you killed. Try fighting Artorias of the Abyss without a very good idea of what his stances mean and you will be murdered. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And even just 25 brings you above certain threshold just as effectively. A tracer with 25 shields will survive a headshot from hanzo just as much as if she had 75 armor and will die to headshot+body shot either way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah i always leave it unprotected. if you're in comp it depends what level you're at. if they're going to hunt it down you cant do much to stop that anyway. you're better used where your team is. think of the TP as a momentum control. while its up you can increase the pressure on teh enemy team by having more of your own in the battle and back quicker. if your team has a solid pace going, and  its stable, then you can place it agressively and early to help maintain that high pressure front. otherwise you'll want to hold on to it and use it more like a mercy res - only place it when a few allies have recently died. if you're really getting hunted down a lot, place it in a bullshit location so the flankers waste time looking for it instead of fighting. you'll want to warn your allies about this first but i've driven tracers crazy as they look for our teleporter since it was nowhere near teh battle, giving us a 6v5 as long as they were hunting. how you use her really is different at every 500SR bracket. i found at the high 2000s people get more agressive about hunting you down for example. above 3000 its about 50:50 on being hunted. and below 2500 almost nobody thinks to hunt you down.

the alt fire only powers up by holding it down. the bigger ball does bigger damage. the primary fire and secondary aren't related unfortunately. i wish.

He/she is! If you look closely at the end, you'll see we showcase health by making the emoticon go through a range of faces from :D to :( !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Marie Curie should turn into a green glowing skeleton that deals extra damage on contact or within her viscinity. Stephen Hawking should be able to enter a black hole where he cannot be damaged (if you attack it, you lose health) and then pop back out at will. Isaac Newton should be able to pick up and throw things, dealing damage based on Newtonian physics, and he should be able to do... something to do with calculus..... Albert Einstein should have something to do with relativity, probably "moving really fast" which would mean slowing his enemy's movement/attacks while he seems to just pop all around the board.

Very disappointed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thinks it's ridiculous that you can be a tank and killed instantly by her. If she freezes you and the shoots an icicle, you're done for.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
arrow also on wrong side, finger over arrow (ouch and bye bye fletchings), completely the wrong size bow and way too short of arrows(very dangerous), bow arm rotated inward (ouch for inevitable string slap), all fingers on string. I really hope she didn't actually shoot it... so many potential areas of injury. The worst being overdrawing with short arrows she could actually shoot her own hand. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
not so much. her rifle does 80 damage, no headshot bonus.  it does 20 damage on hit and then 60 over about 1 second. any healing stops the damage over time. her shots are slow enough so you cant seem to stack the DOT.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can she teleport away the herpes you will give her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Close.

Olympic marksmanship is done with PCP air rifles. So she's holding a compressed air pistol that's shooting a diabolo pellet. 

Something similar to this:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she running away from that zombie that stumbles into shot at the end?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only time I had a mission come down to the wire was when the majority of my A team was wounded, so I had a rookie and squaddie cover for an escort mission. She got shot, panicked, threw a grenade on a lancer that was next to a squaddie ranger, who was on a roof, which in turn collapsed and killed the squaddie. 

I made sure she was not picked up in future missions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They have a red dwarf who shoots molten lava and puts down turrets...they have a girl who shoots ice and turns into an ice cube to regen...they have a big knight with an rectangular energy shield ...they have a jetpack soldier with high jump and a rocket launcher...

There is generic classes and then there is direct copy-pasting.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would be cool if her beam locked onto multiple targets at one time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have much more patience than I would in this situation. I would have pulled her out of the car and beat her to death after she asked me "why didn't you get out of my way?" when she just said "stay right where you are." 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly this. A Finnish girl in my dorm brings her ps4 to the lobby to play this game. She going balls to the walls and playing grounded for her first play through but she get stuck quite often. If she reaches the point where it's too frustrating to keep trying I get to take over. That section took me like 15 attempts to finally make it to the next checkpoint and that's exactly the route I took to beating it. I might go out to buy this game for my ps4 right now....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I live Mercy because she can get in and out of hairy situations quickly, as well as damage buffs and bringing back the dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Originally, she gave 75 shield. This and her teleport were here best assets, making her a support.  Now that she only gives 25 shield, her best assets are her turrets and her teleport.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Traps don't actually kill her though, right? She only dies if you do the damage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shiek is definitely the easiest to recover with in Sm4sh, her up-b is really hard to punish and it covers a really good distance 

Fox you can gimp pretty easily 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but you'll know the angle you need to shoot from so that the arrow goes over the fence kills that woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First half of the fight is much easier if you rush the sage and just wail on her. Second half gets more difficult, but weave in rolls/sprints and tag the closest sage each time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sniper would bludgeon someone to the death with the butt... of her gun.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom used to watch me play Spyro. Once I got stuck on a boss and she got so annoyed of seeing me run around him in circles for days straight. I never noticed she was watching until then. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Run. Do a lot of running and when you're done running do some more running.

Then have him/her go out for another run.

Learn how to do a PLF.

and be good at pushups.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a lass trainer in either the rock tunnel or mt. moon that says something along the lines of "Kyaa, don't touch me" and when you finish the fight, she says "Is that it?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Yeah, girls love a guy who can finish quickly. 

FTFY


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me too..

But there is a silver lining: I had added one of them on Skype and I still talk to her weekly. But still... Just one of them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's not aiming down at him, there's a lock on button. The game is aiming for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How did that second one kill her? It hits the rock and disappears, yet she dies? Is the netcode in BOIII still that terrible? It clearly didn't bounce up and hit her. It hits the rock and she dies. That's pretty pathetic for a group like Treyarch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't he the boss at the end of the bunny girl area too?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hilary would have the Counter-UAV, she want's the place to be a no fly zone.

Ah. I thought you were saying these were high school girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What steps did she take in her life that led her to that shit.  That is beyond degrading
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Have you not met girls? They're just as dumb as boys. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell was going through her mind when she put that diamond in the middle? Its not even centered. AAARRRRGGHJHH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah, if it was a little butler instead of an anime girl, I'd be all over this. My very own Jarvis!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A woman can also reproduce at 12, doesn't mean it's ''reasonable''. Biologically apt =/= reasonable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Worse, New Earth. Like if she was the daughter of a classical languages teacher turned hippy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You've never been on Minecraft haven't you?

Girl: Can I have some diamonds?
Boy: Take mine
Boy: Take mine to
Boy: me three
Boy: want to be my girlfriend I'm 9
Boy: I have butter
Boy: kill the squids!
Boy Here's some
Boy: I got you.
Boy: This naked mod is so hot the blocks are so real
Boy: Say 123 if you want a girlfriend
Boy: Here you go
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually there is. I just don't think you've seen much of her work before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would let your wife know she's married to a high schooler. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it bad that I could understand most of what she said because of anime? ._.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Are!"

"You!"

"High! The girl... she's really high up in this picture."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
About 8 seconds in when the blond girl is saying everyone's names.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There were no men playing that, just boys and some girls. 

So it separated the boys from the boys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No vasectomy, second girl coming and SO wants a boy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Quality over quantity is the exact opposite of "going out and seeing real girls" as you suggested I do. You are either clueless or a hypocrite. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She does think she's entitled.  Not because she's a girl, but because of our society treating everyone like a special snowflake.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mediocre how? That's LeeAnna Vamp, one of the most well known female cosplayers. 

[This is the full outfit.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So, like Sakura Clicker, but with wizards instead of anime girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought they was the game where you play as a Japanese girl and go through your school killing everyone brutally... Is it not that game? Cause it looks like that game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Again, I've never said we can't have physically fit women. And I'd like people to stop pretending like I have.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess he thinks all women should look like the girls in /r/boltedontits (NSFW)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't it great? You keep getting older, but those high school girls *keep staying the same.*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like she just realized what he's *really* married to. ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let me guess, she was either a high school student or an immature college student.

No sane, decent human being would do that preemptively. Man or Woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would he have met her, if he didn't become Comstock?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why's she taking a picture? Everyone looks like a mime in a picture.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
6th grade math teacher or she runs a math club.  Or maybe she's in 6th grade and math club...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if you penetrate it? Do you become the jellyfish thing?

"Look at me, I'm the jellyfish thing now." Then you go and look for some Japanese school girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Similar things were happening in Europe at the time though, people would marry a young girl and have sex as soon as she "bled" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what have we learned from this boys and girls. Do not pre-order wildlands :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he was a sk8er boy she said see u l8ter boy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is really the weirdest thing that could be third? Think about it. The fetish is basically combining the female form with the male genitalia. That seems like it would be pretty high no matter what. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
^ this.  Take the time to work out, improve grades and fuck all those high school girls you've been lookin at.  That's the thing about high school girls man, you keep getting older and they stay the same age....  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I'm the only guy that likes bitchy girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Struggling through that game here and there with my girlfriend.  
  
/u/myrthe- needs to step her game up, really.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the point to shit on girls? 'Cause that's all it seems to do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it's clear you've guaranteed that she's gonna be behind on grading this school year.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except we are taught women should be treated better than men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got it, OP is tired of her coming over every day to play his games. Time to get rid of distraction, good work, high five! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that "thing" on the right side of the picture, with glasses. is it a boy or a girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe if you stopped calling her a him she'd treat you better
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Old grey mare she ain't what she used to be. Ain't what she used to be. Ain't what she used to be.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I showed this to my wife and presented her with a high five. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well my friend, who goes to a different school, so you guys have never met him, and my girlfriend, who goes to a different school also, have played Outlast 2 and they said it's **bitchin**. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You ain't pleasing ur gurl unless you're phasing right through her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
14 guys and 3 girls.... where's Quagmire to do the math? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's her maiden name, which she uses as her middle name since marriage. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This always happens when I try and talk to girls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was going to say marry her but I guess you got the memo.

I sold my pocket watch to buy my girlfriend a new set of combs for her hair. Little did I know, she cut and sold her hair to buy me a new chain for my pocket watch.

Are you suggesting a 22 year old male can't have female anatomy? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For some reason, "play it in a box" made me think...
1: Cut a hole in a box 
2: Put your rocket league in that box 
3: Make her open the box 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; all they can do is credit the amount to her account

Who wrote this? So many mistakes and holes. Things like:

1.Diddy is NOT DK's nephew

2.Dixie is NOT DK's girlfriend (she's Diddy's...plus DK's gf is Candy Kong)

3. Where's Donkey Kong 3?

And so on....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the tip of the day goes to this guy/girl/genderless being. Right here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should have used your Master Ball on her, it's quicker.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just checked my gf's because she never deletes save files and she has already reached 1G
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wonderful, but if anything she went from the Mustang to the donkey; I think I would take any MG over a Chrysler LeBaron 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But did he find a her to open the box? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should get some google play &amp; apple store cards while she's at it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How so? My girlfriend just bought me the game and I've played but I haven't messed with mods yet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except as a manager he can makes these calls at his discretion. If he knows it's happening and the lady isn't even asking for cash back (which is what these scammers want) then there's no incentive for a scammer to be doing this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She can bring things with her, though. There's a section in the game where she steals a set of keys then goes back in time to before she took them but still has them in her inventory. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she put it on a credit card do a charge back.  Fuck best buy for this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That happened to me at game stop the other day, I went to buy a new game and she pulled the cartridge out of the drawer and put it in the case from the wall just like a used game. When I asked about it they said it was because it was the last copy 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. That's why I bought it. So my girlfriend and I could play zombies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"What'd you do on spring break?"

"Your girlfriend and meth"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
GameStop didNINTENDO buy that from her so you probably got a good deal. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she was saving the cap to buy you that new issue of grognak? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but the store mgr at another location isn't going to want to take a loss on a product purchased at another store, he/she will say they can't do anything and to take it back to the store you purchased it at.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I used to work at a grocery store with a lady named Bonnie MacFarlane... she was too old to know anything about RDR though!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'd see her more if you didn't lock her in the closet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I pressed her A and immoderately got a restraining order

I like the one where at some point she's like "gimme my ice cream!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No she doesn't. You have to put it down in order for her to cuddle it which means you already stopped.

Yesterday a girl asked for my digits so I told her; 1:0:29278475.

Why not tell her a steam card so you can buy the game you want
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Trade in &amp; save money"

They know how women work...

Commies are pro women. This guy is clearly a trumpet
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Y'all couldn't have just.. Bought her a PlayStation? Or like.. A Barbie? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Best part is you can then switch to the wife and change what she looks like, then return to your own character and have a custom wife.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
L.A. Noire got my wife interested for a few minutes...that was the closest I got. Since then I've just made female characters that look like her and name them her nickname backwards, Isis. Of course, in the current US climate, that's gotten me some hate but it's now automatic for me. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe **she** is trying to look like a vagina instead. You wouldn't know!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My friend is still running a 6850 and she even played TW3 on it. It wasn't even that great of a card in its time, which was what, 2010-2011?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Savage... she probably didn't need your assistance there, pretty sure she sees enough stuff already 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend and I picked up Trine a little while back on steam and we have had a great time with it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she smokes weed out of an apple.

Who said anything about 2 copies. There was no copy protection back then and you didn't need the cd to play the game once it's installed. My aunt still bought as many copies as she used though. What a weirdo.

I haven't played much of halo 5, you guys are talking about Cortana right? She died in Halo 4 which was a 343 game and then 343 brought her back to life in halo 5.

Halo is my childhood.

Cortana is my fucking BAE (well, Chief found her first, but she's still mine too).

Maybe you got them to the tipping point and then she just set them over.

____________________ TOPIC 17 ______________________________

&gt;  a weird ass angle for her butt

weird-ass angle, or weird ass-angle?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That thing sticking out of her on the bottom right is definitely an eye, though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's out of place. None of my female friends have ass either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it disturbs me the fleshlight can't even match the movement of the girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If only she was doing a side tilt.  Kicks the leg straight up in the air.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dunno what to tell you.

I can't see any way that it could be read as "playful and silly". Her other poses are really clearly playful and silly and her facial expressions make that clear.

I don't really see any suggestion whatsoever in the pose that she was posing that way "ironically". It just looks like any other of the butt poses they added to the game at the same time. They all with the same name, "Over the Shoulder", and all have the same pose. Nothing about Tracer's is different to indicate it's supposed to be some sort of joke.

If it was supposed to be ironic, it pretty seriously failed to communicate that, which is as good as reason to remove it as if it hadn't been ironic. In either case, what's there just looks really out of place amongst Tracer's other poses and victory intros and all that.

I could absolutely see a butt pose that *was* clearly ironic and that would be fine, but I just don't think this was that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this guy had a girlfriend. And she was with him. And he decided to fuck a grill. Why do these people get to have girlfriends but not me? How is this fair?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i have this feeling that tracer and her butt is the face of overwatch 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; she has legs that go all the way up

As opposed to legs that don't?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's not fit enough to be cammy. Look at them legs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dat butt crack is looking at her with that "I'VE GOT YOU IN MY SIGHTS!!!" style...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tracer has sticks for limbs. Nothing about her looks natural.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They replaced the pose with one that shows her ass even more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Frankly: who gives a shit about this? It's a fucking butt. Change it or not, what does it matter? It's not like they changed her outfit or removed her ass altogether. Just a pose. Uproars over the weirdest, least consequential shit...

EDIT: Regardless of the reasoning, you guys are still upset because they removed an ass shot. They are literally everywhere, unnecessarily. Go find a new one if you give that much of a fuck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No. It was the generic 'girl showing off her ass' pose that's been used a million times before. If anything, that's a good reason in itself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the crap are you taking about?

The pose says nothing contrary to her character AT ALL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Well, someone wanted to complain about Tracer having a ~~sexual~~ pose that showed her ass 

Don't dignify their viewpoint by saying the pose was sexual.  It wasn't.  It was an over the shoulder pose and nothing more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her arms are straight lines. It's not even that she isn't ripped, it just looks weird.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's because of the way she's posing. [This]( is closer to what her hip to waist ratio really looks like (although she's still popping her hip out). 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know, right?! Better yet, she's a bit too pretty in the face as well, better put a veil on that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But in all seriousness, that pose wasn't even remotely sexually suggestive at all.

The post made it seem like she was twerking and doing a duck face. She's just standing the other way, with her hip shifted a bit. That's it.

3 other characters have the "Over the shoulder" pose, doing the same thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Old, she has probably changed her mind 5 times since then.. ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is the new one more sexual? She went from showcasing her ass to standing like a flamingo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A think the argument (and the reason Blizzard gave) was that it isn't part of Tracer's personality. She's a Tom-Boy. Not a sexual character at all. This pose felt out of place for her. The same pose exists on other characters including Hanzo and Widowmaker, but it fits them. The butt doesn't angle up for them making it look bad ass on Hanzo and still very very sexual on Widowmaker (but it fits her). Tracer just felt out of place in this pose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"The last pose didn't do a good enough job of showing off how toned her ass is."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tracer had a pose where she had her back to the camera and looked over her shoulder. Blizzard got complaints that it was provocative so they removed the pose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1) All those things you mentioned about Tracer's pose being designed to showcase her butt, is pretty much how she stands [all the time]( And since you seem to know a lot about anatomy, I'm sure you already know that this is all textbook 101 stylizing for drawing females in comics.

So is the problem her pose, or the angle at which we're viewing her?

2) Look at [this]( picture of her in the exact same pose, but in a different outfit. Do you still feel that the predominant focus point is her butt? 

So is the problem her pose, or the outfit she's wearing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel bad for the waist cincher she's clearly wearing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Spare me the bullshit. There's a big difference between facing the camera and not facing the camera. If the pose was exactly the same, but adjusted to point towards the camera, that'd be fine. But it isn't, because it's not "just standing", she's showing off her ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hanzo stands back straight while Tracer has her arms cocked and is slightly bent forward. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't have guessed she looked like this! Her face says so much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No they don't. The men don't have their shoulders and hips in even remotely the same position. The closest is Widowmaker, and the pose works better for her anyway.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
/r/whataboutSRS

They missed the part where the person was completely fine with the same pose being on Widowmaker, because she's a character defined by her sexiness. Tracer is not.

The problem was never the ass. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That suit will be poopy where it goes up her ass crack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me too to be honest. I thought it was Tracer bending downwards, with her butt facing the camera.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well thing is was it wasn't that she was to sexual, the person argued it didn't fit her character.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly, the old pose wasn't even really sexual at all. It was just awkward. It's like they wanted to do an over-the-shoulder pose for her but never really figured out how she should look doing it and ended up with a half-assed pose- it doesn't say "Tracer", it just says "Over the Shoulder".

The new pose, on the other hand, is totally in Tracer's character. It's energetic, fun, and shows just enough butt to be sexual without making it look like she's trying to show off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, she sticks her ass out. Try it for yourself. Stand like Tracer, then stand like Hanzo. 

Standing like tracer makes your butt stand out. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They also changed Cammy's intro as well. It used to be angled lower to show her ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty amazing, she hardly has any ass at all and that's apparently too sexual. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rin is only best girl if your a guy that only does leg day.

Otherwise Lilly or Emi.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We may work our asses off for a living, but she just works her ass for a living.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
they're out of sync for one but i think a lot of the funny comes from the faces which the girls aren't pulling off as well. i still like how their arms are up instead of down though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah...but they didn't say that did they. They just said that they'll be looking at it, and that they have another pose in mind that would better capture her personality. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how many markers are used to motion capture her butt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her face looks like it was superimposed on her... face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't see how the pose was sexual. Was it because you could see her ass?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shit maybe I just never really thought about it that way since ass is usually emphasized on women more. Now I feel I need to tone my ass more since my squats are prob not heavy enough
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The way it gets so close to her fucking face makes me uncomfortable.. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah i mean, I though that by this time she was already closed

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping they would all turn and follow it over her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend and I did exactly the same thing with the Last Guardian. Oops.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thats girls I knew "wanted" to do it because they would be disowned otherwise. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But then I saw pamella. I have never seen woman so beautiful. I must find her in her underwater panties.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1. Did that really OHK her?   
2. What exactly is the difference between a brutality and fatality? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it was definitely Joel. he called her "kiddo". only Joel did that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think Joel's dead and in Ellie's head while she's avenging his death
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohh, yeh, quite right. I think I've found her grave.. 


I guess this was filled in after the event.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[](/ajdribbles) Doesn't matter.  If she's not a pony, she's garbage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know right she squinted and told Joel to move and this guy acts like he just uncovered Ellie's entire emotional drive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean she is crying the whole time during the last level like she knows.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I kinda wish they hadn't made this, the end to the first game was so perfect. The fact that Joel had stolen the one shot at a cure that humanity had. It lined up perfect with the title, in the final moments of the game (Spoiler BTW) when she asks him if everything he told her about not needing her brain was true, when he lies to her.. That was the last moment humanity had a chance of pulling through. It is "The Last of Us" because after that moment there was no hope left, whether everyone knew it or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Couldn't she please everyone by just doing cosplay of characters that are already slutty?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This. This is the best. I just hope she has the right traits, or out she goes...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly: oh you saved that suicidal girl's life?  WELL SHE DIED IN A TORNADO.

Oh, you saved "fuck your selfie"?  Dead.

Saved fat girl?  Dead.

Watered your plant every day?  Very dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shhhh, that's when you play it safe and lie...say she is 47 and only has fangs 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope you took a byte out of her ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For fucks sake...the girl and the tiger...I couldn't even watch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If her name was a Greek god, what god was it? You're not really close except for at the end.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I too only acquired women for my Assassin's hideout.

I left all the men to die, I regret nothing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's incredibly selfish. His own desire to have a daughter was greater than the desire to save humanity. If he had asked Ellie if she would die to save mankind she probably would.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was it ever acknowledged if she wanted to find the cure no matter what (them killing her) or if she wanted to live without there being a cure? 

I thought Joel never told her that they found the firefly camp and what they were going to do after rescuing her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she knew what she was doing then she has something seriously wrong with her, I'm glad we now agree.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn, that explains why it felt so right to make her look like Jack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's the beauty of the game! When you play it, you might do better than me and save her!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually thought the kid was a girl and I could save her because from far back... Brian did not look THAT dead..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's okay. I nuked Megaton city, then was so shocked a certain someone hadn't died that I lost her and had to spend time hunting her down to kill her again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those are the soldiers who deserve death. I had a specialist who panicked for TWO FULL TURNS because she got set on fire. She burned to death, despite being the one with the fucking medkits.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Couldn't have said it better myself. She knew exactly what she was doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I knew that was a woman! I knew right when I saw it and watched it a few turns to see what made me think that. I thought, "is this some really mundane male superpower or just my imagination?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Beautiful collection. If that doesn't impress or turn on a girl then she's not for you. Unless you're already seeing someone. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh my god this is amazing. I hope Bill Gates sees this and sees how happy he made this girl. Bill Gates is seriously the best rich guy ever. Literally the richest man in the world and he does so many good things with his wealth. :')
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hope so, otherwise someone get that girl a sandwich.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really hope that Joel is alive and not just a figment of her imagination. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, putting her in the garbage disposal would've done nothing but make a mess and clog the sink.  
Possibly even cause havoc with the whole septic system.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh god I need this, my girl friend is terrified of whales
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet many people found her death very sad. I think that's impressive personally.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always assumed she meant, "Please don't die out there."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The photographer wants the people to save the gear too..trust me. 

Like will smith in IRobot. "Save the girl!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he DID save the girl and follow her to make sure she got home safe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You... You *do* realize that you're watching a *Japanese* girl playing a demo at the *Tokyo* Game Show, right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I planned on sacrificing Kaiden this time but Ashley seems annoying, does she turn out better?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I reckon Joel is dead. Ellie goes out on a revenge odyssey after the people responsible, during which she is kinda losing her mind and being visited by Joel
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its really satisfying killing her, she had it coming to her... But I must ask, how much does the beginning differ when you follow the imperials?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think that was supposed to be kind of sarcastic, since she knew what was causing the splashing the whole time.

____________________ TOPIC 19 ______________________________

She seems so badass now, even though she already was a badass. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every time you die in super metroid you see her because her suit flys off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy in the suit in metroid is is a girl...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean more that she's not absurdly or unrealistically tall.  Amazonian isn't how I'd describe her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The banner image looks like she's piloting a fighter jet. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No but she is female and has some definition in game so, of coarse, rule 34
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't like the other being removed, but honestly I am really liking this one.  I think it suits her playful demeanor well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should have made a version of that game where she was traversing Dante's Inferno called "Where in the hell is Carmen Sandiego?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're not trying to be historically accurate, except you know, no female soldiers for whatever reason.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she play the originals aka Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake? And she ever played NES Metal Gear and Snake's Revenge?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But why wouldn't you want space between? Boobies need to breathe woman!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But her lower body has no shape at all really. It looks unnatural. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Without the wings, she looks more like a Zero Suit Samus Medic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it wouldn't be as good with women because it is historically inaccurate...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her assets were a lot more pronounced when she was a sprite IMO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plot twist, she thinks he's just playing a simple video game...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Habe you ever played Metroid? It's canon. Samus is a girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost like the US congress. A bunch of men talking about how women should feel about their bodies and representation. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love all of these but I really want to see like an Amazonian samus. I always pictured her as being built like she hulk. Like 6'2"and powerful as fuck. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But  when she converts the energy back into a body, is it *really* Samus?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Edited my original post to include that I thought it was bad because it looked super basic.  Turns out the character is just super basic.  Kudos for her if it is accurate!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And now the Zero Suit is all she wears, kind of a bummer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Samus in her 8bit glory?  Not unless you go [justin bailey](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[This]( is official artwork of her, you could see how easily rule 34 would get into it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you were a body builder yourself, you'd like her. 

I'm going to guess you're not. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's because she's an average height for a girl where as we're used to seeing Samus in game at over 6 ft.  She's supposed to be very tall for a woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tira is the type of girl that turns me off when I go down on a girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like they seem to be a symbiote or something they morph to the very shape of her body
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fair enough; just think a flying/steel type suits her better myself. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Duh...it's a type of girl scout cookie. The best cookies ever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plot twist, she thinks he's just playing a simple video game...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Games are terrible because they portray women with unrealistic proportions. No one actually looks like... @o@
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most legit response. Honestly though I'm just playin. No offence.  You're a good sport. Or whatever the female version of sport is. Should still be sport right? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That looks a little bit like Lana Beniko. May too skilled/powerful, though. Can't be her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, alright, let me just call her up, I'll get back to you.

Alright, I'm back. She said no.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a set of Copic markers and my girl has a set of prismas so it was a mix
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's some great form there by the girl...


but yeah.... not really something i'd want on my body.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
...Samus. Her name is Samus, Metroids are the shit she kills.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't these have ATROCIOUS character models?  Like Alyx with a midriff which exposes her six pack abs, which complement her dark brooding mascarra?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why did she turn into a guy in the last panel?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guarantee she does not have the proper permits and liscencing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*ahem* You mean you'd like to show her your *solid snake*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We don't shelter her, she can play what she wants, when she wants.  If she doesn't like it, turn it off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The suit is actually very form fitting, and maybe adds an inch or two to her height. She does stand at a fairly tall 6'3 out of suit however.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she gets a lot of love and recognition. Just not the type that she wants...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, but it's a bit of a stretch to call her a badass when she didn't do a single thing besides that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. With the amount of girls and women playing games these days, it really makes no sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can also get a [7 meter body pillow of ~~best girl~~ some snake girl for $115](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Nicholas cage one would be even better if the woman was Nicholas cage too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And would she even have the cannon without the full suit?

____________________ TOPIC 20 ______________________________

I'm actually in tears laughing and my girlfriend thinks I'm nuts for laughing so much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha my girlfriend and I have so much fun recreating this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess if you play a female character it would be "No Ma'am's Sky"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget the ring girl! Can't have a boxing ring without a ring girl!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well,  all these men think they can come up in her sky.  It's no man's sky.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
haha she looks funny and a little bit sexy ;) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are correct.  We never see her swim (as that would cause her to drown).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awww that's so adorable and kind....

I'm still not going to watch or subscribe to her though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, I think you just caught her trespassing on your star ship.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like we never really "forget them" because a lot of things will reminds you of him / her !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Goes to show you don't mess with a tribe of female gingers﻿
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It really kinda is though. My girlfriend would laugh at me if I got her this haha
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has a good sense of humour. We both laughed when she did that 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good guys! Really good of you! She will cherish this for her entire life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are you so bitter, OP? Did the mean girls make fun of your hat? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha it's funny cause he was wrong and she slapped him for it hahaha
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess she should have made the sandwich when asked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awesome, just dye her hair pink and make her [smirk]( and she'll be perfect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Funny how she tried to use Jamie Foxx to back her side when I just watched a video of him, snoop Dogg and wiz khalifa playing battlefield one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never said it wasn't a girl, just used "guys" without thinking
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, probably because her "no no no" reminded me of [this.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not a war on women, a war on ignorance, interesting that you'd conflate the two. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not telling him to break up with her or get a wedding ring.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what kind of wife plays video games without her wedding ring... a bit suspicious
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a girl but it's fine I don't mind being called man I guess.

How many girls you know in total? How many of of those girls you know well enough that you know they definitely don't play?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she know about the tonberrys yet? Actually, never mind, they look pretty harmless.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm kinda lost here, we're talking about the girl or the game?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm guessing she wanted him to cram a Pom bottle up her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How would she use this against you anyhow? Doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't you just laugh it off. You probably have no girlfriend. Which is totally fine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she's the mother of ICP? Makes sense.

*Makes sense because of her name, come on, guys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure he's / she's joking for entertainment purposes. Why be real when its not real.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This illustrates so clearly the shenanigans women have to put up with with guys. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get her another ring and see if PSVR shows up too
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she let's him haha. I wouldn't want someone roaming in around my crops if I were this technical about the game haha
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm female but I didn't suspect him at all. Episode 4's ending really blew my mind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I am more of a Star Trek girl myself, I do like star wars a lot. I'll have a look at it. Thank you! :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to be with my Star Wars girl {[:'^(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awesome. I'd love to do something like this at my place but my SO is kinda picky about decor and she's not into video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's always fun to see someone passionate about something. So entertaining to watch. :) Like the star wars mask woman! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope, just sheer absent mindedness. I love her so much haha.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just want to see the rest of her hat...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i just realized that james was a total womens man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kind of reminds me of Zatanna. All she needs are fishnets and the right hat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you're an ass, but that was a humorous description. I know a girl like that. you forgot to mention the pintrest obsession.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; You fought valiantly. But you are just a man.

Uh uh. A woman.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But if she was already playing before they invited her over, why did she take the JoyCons off of the portable part?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks to me like he's saw a spider and is doing a girly side hop.

____________________ TOPIC 21 ______________________________

Best D.Va Cosplay I've ever seen. They should make her look like this in-game!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Although Jessica Nigri is a bit skanky, I think she cosplays Rikku better than this. Still good though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
everyone bashes on D.Va and plays Winston and Roadhog over her, But for me she is the best character in the game. It also hard counters Winston and can beat roadhog relatively easily so it works well for me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure someone on the Football/Basketball team already has her covered.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just counter him with Moonraker Elite (b)...the girl is Oddjob-short for some reason.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her Rapunzel cosplay is absurdly perfect. It's kind of insane how perfect a lot of her cosplays are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she's just supposed to be an elitist Korean MLG.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So I guess it would be better to say she is the only support character without the ability to heal. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For sure, I usually play reaper, and I rarely have trouble with Mei unless she's really good. So I'm sure a lot of people just don't know how to deal with the matchup. A good Mei will make it tough on reaper, and a good reaper will make it tough on mei
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she only traces back like 3 seconds, so unless you nut in &lt;3 seconds, she is tracing back to where you are still inside her (unless you nutted on her, then nut away!)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, she's good in a lot of team comps like Lucio and Soldier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; they will/ should focus her before you.

Not if its my team.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The girls of League of Legends still have Overwatch beat...so far.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok let me rephrase it. She put a lot of effort into looking like roadhog when she literally can't look like roadhog unless she gains like 300 pounds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
can you all stop focusing on her body. the cosplay is amazing well done.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, literally the two best games(imo) that are console exclusive. This girl games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she calls herself Azzy, I'd say she was made to cosplay Overwatch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's already the most attractive hero but she's also Korean so it's not even fair to the others there
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see more PoTGs from supports than for Tracer, Mei (which is a good thing because no one should play her until she is fixed), Pharah, Soldier 76, etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure he means she doesn't look "Chinese". Which is a fair call. Because she's Korean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
reminds me of orianna from league of legends you should cosplay as her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
low effort game, low effort girlfriend, low effort video, low effort post, low effort life
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking she kind of already looks like junkrat.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she has seen some shit. Great cosplay though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That little guy must be as strong as Reinhardt to pick her up. She's as thicc as Mei.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These cosplay are always the hottest things I've ever seen, the female ones
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No... Let's just say, she like to play with my best friends console...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is definitely female handwriting. Agreed on the point though. Really wish it had seen a pc release at least.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh she's seen me play a ton, she is just hesitant to play console games (I have it on ps4)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I main her but lucio, Mai, Winston, 76, and phara are still played 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love playing her. I don't understand why more people don't. She is not the best tank but she has this tank / support thing going on that is very strong and her damages can be huge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most of these are fantastic but Taylor Swift is an abomination compared to the Yeezus next to her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she supposed to be Shahdee from Prince of Persia? Because she fucking nailed it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Okay I agree that a PC for gaming is better than any console. However, that does not mean consoles are bad. Besides, she wanted a PS4 so let her have a PS4. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When most people say main they mean that it's the main character they play as, not the only character they play as. I mainly play as widowmaker, but if I see that my team already has a sniper, I'm not going pick her. I choose another role that the team is lacking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks extremely annoyed, I guess it means she totally nailed the cosplay!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks great in my opinion. If she keeps doing it, she'll be excellent at it. Cosplay is really amazing 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That early, I think the majority say 6 was the best.  They have 7 and 9 on Android and Iphones for fairly cheap now.  Should get her one of those.  I absolutely loved both of those.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah - I guess she would be a better defense rather than support hero.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck I thought she was Katarina from League of Legends at first
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so many people who thought she was crazy now think she is a hero...

smh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Too many times have I almost killed a Mei and then she heals herself to kill me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
McCree is the answer to everything. Except Widowmaker. The only thing that kills her is a better Widowmaker.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you think you know better than a team of 24 professional analysts?


(Scroll down a bit untill you see a woman)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
people complain when I pick widowmaker... they don't understand how useful she is to defense and offense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why? It feels great (unless the girl have raptor nails that is).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not bad, not bad, but she looks more like she's cosplaying Jessica Rabbit cosplaying Jessie of Team Rocket.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she thought it was a PC not a PS4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is an Overwatch cosplay? I thought she was doing a Water Bender cosplay...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How could she not like overwatch!? I feel like that game is for everyone 

____________________ TOPIC 22 ______________________________

Thats a hell of love from my girl, you wouldn't understand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but can she tell where she ends and the zombies begin?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well in Genisys exactly this happens. Kyle Reese comes back but good old man Arnold is already there and Sarah is already battle hardened because a T1000 was sent back to kill her as a little girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not like I'm forcing her to game, more or less giving her a chance to see if she likes it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she needs no guns, and no one is/was/will be willing to harm her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No idea who those women are. Presuming some reality bints? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Falling the first time was entirely her fault for trying to do a wheelie in such a cramped place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I say not blowing your man on a regular basis will cause another woman to do it.
Balls too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even so, unless she's changed Java's 4gb hard limit of RAM for any single process then it's going to blow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The first game focuses on her immunity, so I doubt it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
thats not the bad part, the entire profile is basically just an add to her porn site

._.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For real all I thought was...a girl that you shouldn't be with in the first place!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jaime will keep her in check eventually. Unless he becomes her prince consort and becomes equally insane
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because he's not a perfect husbando for the fangirls who just want another Alistaire.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's all well and dandy, Good for him/her, but it shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have no idea who the fuck these characters are...the hell is going on the Mario World? Looks like a furry and a little girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well no its a male power fantasy still serving the same purpose as the over sexualized females
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, she just goes back to the destination I sent her the last time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the tricky thing. If the piston can be stopped by Chell applying a force then it should be even if portals are there. It's not some something that can be kinesthetically intuitive, but the downward movement of the piston depends on the net forces being applied. If moving the piston downward lessens the space Chell can occupy and causes her to compress, then her compression creates a resistive, "upward" force against the downward force of the piston. If that resistive force is enough to stop the moving piston, then it will. 

This is of course assuming Newtonian type physics even work anymore which they don't if portals exist. You gotta remember portals defy every physical law we have.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also she supports the agenda of a genocidal migrant fleet that would seek to exterminate the innocent Geth. Minus one point. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So for those looking to place an order, it's first come first serve at this point, and her email is nerdygirlsdoitbetter@gmail.com
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That happened back in the past though. As an adult, Link had to give back the ocarina so she could reverse everything that happened as a result of Ganondorf's campaign
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No idea, but I'm going to guess it happens when she is "on fire".

Another dubious connection to The Hunger Games.

*conspiracy intensifies*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When it comes to physical abuse, women have all the power. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only thing that would make this better is if her nipples were hard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that single eyeball belonging to a girl named Kayla?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cause people can change. Marriage seems to drastically change a lot of women (not all). Perhaps men too but I don't have anecdotal experience for that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They still aren't adding female characters to the roster. Soooo looks like the gaming industry can take it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your girlfriend is a phenomenal artist, please message me if custom orders become available in the future, thank you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He actually delivers a really swift and forceful kick, probably breaking her back in the process. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's completely baloney that when ever a woman does anything remotely successful someone somewhere is going to say it's only because she's a woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then I guess there's no issue as she's doing exactly as she pleases, hooray freedom
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's there, but I left it open for people who might be seeking desirable men. 

Sure, for girls gamers there is no limit to the selection but as they say "The odds are good, but the goods are odd."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It indicates focus.  A feminist focuses on issues affecting women, a masculinist focuses on issues affecting men, an egalitarian doesn't have a focus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
theres a bigger issue here, is tha a woman or a man? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What did she expect?  She doesn't even have any guns. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You and her wouldn't get along because your priorities are completely unaligned. Even if you are very handsome, it wouldn't work. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Please explain how a feisty, energetic, and fun loving character tauntingly looking over her shoulder is so widely out of character that it warrants being removed from the game despite the developers thinking it was in character enough to add in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Going off your username I doubt your the target audience for female Lv goods. 

 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. I don't understand what the hell happened to Shaundi, cause she's a completely different character in the sequels to it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What I'm saying is hiring a special team to focus on just her when she's already been exonerated is a violation of due process. It singles her out for special persecution on no grounds other than paranoid conspiracy theories.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, they say that all the fucking time, because power fantasy,blah blah.

Which of course, explains [this perfectly]( these women are clearly being exploited and not doing it by their own volition to have some kind of power over the guys they want to fuck. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
they wouldn't even take me to hell after I'm done with this girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The joke was more that these women aren't valued for their accomplishments anyway or even allowed much freedom to accomplish anything. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm giving it all she's got, Captain! If I push it any harder, the whole thing will blow!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
C.S. Lewis also sent Susan to hell because she stopped believing in Narnia.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Women wouldn't have boob sculpted breastplates because women weren't knights.

Women wouldn't have boob sculpted breastplates because those would have been much more difficult to forge.

As for deflecting certain blows inwards, that wouldn't really matter. A sword isn't going to pierce a breastplate no matter how much you deflect it inwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she thought sending it would send the original, and then she wouldn't have it anymore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Possibly quieten getting in touch with the guys and girls over at special effect?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the problem at it's core is that people are trying to change things by force instead of by action. If you don't like that a certain game sexualizes women, don't buy that game. Buy the one where women are represented. Start a game company and make games with your ideals. If people stop supporting it then companies change it. 

____________________ TOPIC 23 ______________________________

Yeah, it was concept art. She's now not chubby, and every fat girl wants to be Mei now.  

If we start believing conceprt art then we're all gunna be disappointed, because so much concept art is better than the real thing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would be really interesting. Like she still goes through it but what normally takes a few days takes her years
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was younger(12-13) I though anal porn was annual porn. Like these girls only get fucked once a year and they film it. Then I got glasses and it all made sense
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True. She is amazing but I don't think she's *unusually* understanding. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always judge any games character creator by how many sliders they have for adjusting the female breast.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But what if I want to talk to her in an effort to get to know her, not figure out how to get to the library?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but does she have any idea what those things are?

doubtful
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  concepts like 'male' and 'female' don't apply to her species.

I think people need to check usernames more. His literally says Man_AMA. What were you supposed to do? Assume he's a girl and not ask anything?! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a legit girl, though, not a legit son. Legit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe that I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just don't see the harm in trying to figure out why there aren't more women in game development. I feel like there's more to it than 'they just don't want to'. I'm not satisfied with that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While they clearly used Kate Upton's likeness, they covered their bases by hiring a similar looking woman to pose for the photo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not just women, many game characters are just tropes.

It's lazy character development.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn't. It's the way she goes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So based on my (possibly snarky) 2 line comment, you've inferred I've never had a girlfriend?


Tell me more. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I had to do a double take when I met her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was back in the Fearless era, [she's grown up]( since her teens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
'Every girl wants a piece of you'.. Is this some kind of splatter film?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not familiar with the game, but did they seriously make some women incapable of producing male children, or is that your superstition? Because biology doesn't work that way, but I could see making a game work that way to create exactly this sort of scenario...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he also goes out of his way to learn just enough of her language to ask her for consent.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This was taken completely out of context. It's a very popular Ted talk in which she is promoting video games and saying that more people should actually be playing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, the photo was taken from bed and she made the photo
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was definitely an English language instruction manual (for SMB2 I'm pretty sure) that referred to Birdo as a boy who thinks he's a girl. I've seen a copy in person (I know, I know, not the greatest evidence)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Emily looks up to and respects Corvo and she's still young and naive, if she sees you killing people to get what you want she'll assume that's the best way to do it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ummm................ I believe the Japanese style name is "Ayanami Rei". And she's Japanese.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The female standard is entirely enforced by the male standard though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Hanako Ikezawa is the best girl

Says the man who doesn't know how to appreciate a footjob.

With that attitude no woman would get with you, not even if you were TheLastDudeguy on Earth

#1 Bride - glasses #2 girl next to her - glasses

Based on her Instagram I think that is from this particular photo. She has other ones that look more natural. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget to appreciate it as she tried and exchange if possible :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All that work and the image is squashed. Kerrigan appears thinner than she is in the original art.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean atypical. I don't think I've seen women volunteer themselves as rails at the Xgames.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that first person supposed to be Sophie Wu? Looks exactly like her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she just doesn't consider the Daedric Princes to be "gods," including Dagon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not even the same art, the women look completely different
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless doubting herself is what she needs.  Is it right to kill all babies? Never doubt yourself ciri.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the japanese term for an intersex person - usually depicted as a girl with a cock and vag.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know this isn't /r/gameofthrones but I really didn't get why she said that. She put so much effort just to get to that place and learn how to be noone and then just says fuck it and leaves?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it so you can look at the tattoo instead of her while you're bangin'?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think its a similar concept to /r/girlswithneonhair (NSFW). Sometimes just a little bit different is a whole lot sexier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but why are you assuming that girls only play bejeweled in the first place?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't worry, I'll have a daughter and name her Origin.

Then it wouldn't be weird.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're assuming she isn't already doing one of these things. Just because someone plays games doesn't mean it's all they do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For some reason I could tell these were done by a female artist before I got to the end. I think its because instead of keeping all the old designs, the artist made the characters almost unrecognizable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this apolo justice or does she also appear in the other games? Im on Apolo justice atm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What bothers me most about this is people saying that she can't be a girl's role model. A *silly* video game character should not be a role model and is not meant to be one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was talking about them in terms of best girl you know...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And she appeared on talk shows to promote the game


____________________ TOPIC 24 ______________________________

Ooo yeah~~~!  I love it when girls cover up.  So hot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the female nidoran is in both red and blue right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every girl I talk to says one of the reasons they always wear yoga pants is that they are super comfy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right to nitpick.  The entire outfit is terrible.  She pulls it off because she's hot, but the details of the outfit are way off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes I feel like the only person who made my female character actually wear armor
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
their exact conversation:

&gt; her: do you have to wear that helmet?

&gt; him: no. ... but it helps!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure that's a girl on the right with short hair and glasses. That's only one though; the game should still be pretty good!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What?  Most of Sonya's looks are just fine.  Even Cassie is cute when she's not running the Miley Cyrus outfit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The witchers go dress up in Yennifer's clothing and try to dial a girl using her megascope. Instead, they call an old dignitary while he's on the shitter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Elder Scrolls and Fallout push it with some of their female variants - they're clearly more revealing than the male variants (though I think it's become less of a difference lately).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, she would have been so hot in another year or two.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has a costume where she wears full body armor 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It just looks like a girl with blue hair in a Christmas costume ....... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's literally what Juliet Starling looks like. She's a skimpy dressed cheerleader. Should she be dressed as a nun instead?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also she likes it when you run around in your underwear. She's the only woman that appreciates your body.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would also dress like a woman if I got to see Tifa in those clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dont see the short hair and long hair thing.


Edit: nvm i see it, a woman in the rock
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Another one there to the statue of a woman next to it is "praise chest"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Have you seen a girl with ashen hair? 

"ISLE let you know if I see her again, come to think OF it.... You just MIST her. "
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rem is in there, but she's called blue hair girl for whatever reason. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, this girl would be hot even if she was dressed like Barrett
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;If you look at her pants those seem pretty tight

as are mine right now
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A man who wears drag,and women are the same because they both wear women's clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen a lot of these and she never looks happy to be wearing any of these clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my coffee...

Hot, sweet and black
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, most bikini armor in previous TES games were the work of modders and not Bethesda, I think the most revealing vanilla clothes/armor was female Forsworn armor and Nocturnal's robes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, is her shirt painted on or is that just a really well-done cell-shaded look on a tight shirt? I can't tell, but maybe I didn't look at it long enough.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are people calling those green things polygons? Those are Zbrush zspheres. Did she use photoshop to colorize them green or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah she wants to play dress down instead ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He-man runs around in underwear AND shows his nipples. I'd say that's a bit more revealing than most women in video games, albeit not by much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So clear this up, what are you saying, that Kamala is a bad super hero because she isn't wearing latex?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What does she look like with her clothes off, I mean her cosplay clothes off, I mean normally in real life...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[You are never too old to make a Let's Play of Skyrim and Fallout 4 either.]( Note that she is 79.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What part of this is NSF?  I've seen women at work wearing less.  Not bad, but not NSF gets you a downvote. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
snorlax's costume is by far better than whatever she is
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some chick peed in my brother bathtub once, and would not keep her clothes on after re-dressing her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't you have anything to say?

I'm not even a girl. I just think long hair on men and short hair on women is fugly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ah she has a pair of denim underwear. 

I love when girls wear those. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; If I saw her, I would just think "that's a hot redhead".


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's the best part, wearing it repels women so you never have to take off your shirt!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she forgot to shave her body. Whats up with all that chest hair ? yuck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
there was a girl at emerald city comicon a few years back that had a better one. They make all their own costumes and she didn't wear underwear...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A  girl has brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes. A girl is noone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will spray my hot juicy foam all over her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
female sylvaris cover up in GW2 because wearing revealing clothes has a stigma
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really? I mean, he was probably exaggerating, but the girl herself is still one super gorgeous redhead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen this before yet I still giggled like a little girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why do I want to look at some dude in a costume when looking at a hot girl in a costume is an option?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is one thing I love about FFXIV. I have a female paladin, in full armor the only thing you can see is her eyes. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Picture her hair as red and [amanda seyfried]( could pull off the look.

____________________ TOPIC 25 ______________________________

one of the girls lost her parents and was burnt in a fire.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You better hurry then. She might crush that poor girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend once asked me why I watch games instead of playing them.

I said it's sort of like you watching baby programs instead of actually having a baby

Now I have a baby :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know those feels. My sister is 14 years younger. When she was born, some of the nurses asked if I was the father.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*Wow, she really misses her droid.*. 

"Err, all the time?"  
"You don't want to know".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it hurts too much. We need to get over half-life and accept that she's never coming back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's obviously an exaggeration. But can you really say that the WoW females are not a lot more human-like than their male counterparts?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My niece isn't even born yet and I already know this is what she's being born into :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bae is either a 15yo girl or a 53yo mother of four. I can't decide which.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep on being a good parent and don't think about what other people think of your parenting. You're raising her, not them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
right on, i loved watching mine eat crickets when she was a baby.  she'd devour so many.  

she's mainly into salad these days. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have family in Mexico that could help him/her out. ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When "bae" doesn't care about her parents being home because she's not a kid, and neither are you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought I was pretty good until I introduced this game to my mother. Fuck me, she was making crazy combos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't ever let this girl become a drug dealer... naw mean?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Trust me, you'll figure it out as soon as you see her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right now she's his girlfriend. Soon, she'll be his daughter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well for one thing, my wife was working when I got the mortgage, she has since had a baby, and for another I got a loan after I got the mortgage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you know that male seahorses, not female seahorses, give birth to baby seahorses? That's why that game was allowed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Strong drugs can kill the feels... but also make a young woman hallucinate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you cut her into 4 slices? I don't think I could eat 8.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
O jeez that's horrible! .. why does the woman look like she's in pain already? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They did work on 'getting over her feelings', it was just while she was a child still that they helped her recover.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It seriously looks like those knockers help her get the weight up. Inertia FTW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean most of these aren't that bad they're just kids after all. But the last girl made my head hurt
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Giving family recipes to people without actually giving the full recipe away... I don't know. Its her thing, I just eat cookies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My aunt adopted a baby from a skinny drug-free 22 year old girl who didn't know she was pregnant, kid was born healthy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Noire is best girl though

Maybe Uzume but she's not in Re;birth 3
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She want's her baby back, and the chef wants some baby back ribs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Make her play Half-life 1 and 2, then tell her there is NO third.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Games don't make people angry. Not having any legitimate outlet makes people angry. Goes for adults and children, men and women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really like the name Madeline. I never knew one personally and always thought I would name my daughter that. Never had nor will I ever have children. I am glad that some little girl will have that name though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Has a better system than me and I'm twice her age...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That explains it. I thought rich older men just didn't realize they were with a younger woman because they couldn't see well due to their age.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd believe it, since most of the people who play The Sims are women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She does know. She just doesn't care and loved it anyways because she feels it's still her child. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's symbolic of a mother breast feeding her child, it's Liberty (mother) leading the people (the children). At least that's how it was explained to me 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, very cool. I hope she keeps it up and continues to grow. Seems like she is having the time of her life. :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ahh, Joe Guest. Had a lot of happy times in my head with her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess if some women from Boston is saying it? "Martha, did ya see that cack on that guy?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that why she isn't into Pokémon? Cause that is actually a great game for kids, obviously
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one who thinks this is a bit excessive for a girl this young?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, we are saying she killed a child. Which she did. How to proceed is up for debate, but being 14 doesn't suddenly make her not someone who killed her child. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This wouldn't be that freaky if she didn't stare like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do you mean miss? My baby girl still puts in work! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If the baby daisy had seen DK she probably wouldn't have let him draft her, which is what let him pass her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't worry for OP - his girlfriend's son is not his son anyway.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you that fella that goes around hackin' and wackin' and smackin' all the women's meat?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the alternative is giving her half your stuff so she goes away?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Michigan it use to be a misdemeanor to curse in front of women and children. They just got rid of the law December of last year. 


____________________ TOPIC 26 ______________________________

That would be my wife to a T. This is also why she must never learn about mine craft. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I personally don't play any FPS games though I know some women that do.  I just don't want to deal with people most of the time.   The only multiplayer games I play are MMORPGs where there's plenty of solo content to appease me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're patient and she likes puzzles, I would recommend portal 2 co-op. However, it might not be the best. Nintendo is always a good place to start. Do you have multiple consoles/systems you could use to play online?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tbf, Bayo games are decently difficult so you need to be looking at someone else playing for that or just have her walking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Check out Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. It's a really cool 2d game where you can play co-operatively and that really allows you to balance out the "workload" depending on the skill. So even she's not that good with games, you can easily "pick up the slack" and you both will have a blast.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You could get her into the early Fallout games. Turn based combat RPGs are a good way to get her started. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm hating that people feel the need to try Anna because she's new.. Yeah she's new.. Pick a player you know or we'll lose
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried some of the campaign this weekend and it's stunning visually, it's exactly what I've been wanting for a few years now, an old-time war game in modern graphics. Hopefully she will be as entertained watching as you are playing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she can certainly explore my hidden riches

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More cliche than a veteran survivalist trekking along in a barren wasteland full of zombies with a little girl? 

Part of what makes Naughty Dog great is their ability to take the cliches, and make them extraordinarily intriguing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had a low key crush on her back in the day. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Without knowing more about her preferences, the LEGO games are always a great place to start.

They're colorful/fun, generally easy-to-play, and designed around local two-player co-op. Pick a franchise she likes that has a LEGO version (shouldn't be that hard at this point) and start there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Great. Now that she's bit, you can now introduce her to something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the only game she's ever played is candy crush saga on her iphone 5, is that a dealbreaker?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lego games are a great co-op experience, and they have tons of options for theme depending on what she likes... Harry Potter, superheroes, Indiana Jones.  They're fun, easy, and help build coordination with the controller for beginners.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend is not great at the first person games like portal, but I would definitely recommend the lego games as well as rayman legends. It's a really fun platformer that is easy to get a grasp on and the teamwork makes the game a lot more fun. If you're into horror games like I am I find that it can be a lot of fun to play them and get scared together. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I wouldn't ever suggest that. At best, it would be in downright bad taste. They should just stick to non-pregnant women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Far Cry 4, but I still thought it was good. Just not...my most enjoyable game. I'm a huuuuge fan girl over Far Cry 3, and 4 was such a let down and not as fun, and it became an effort to complete towards the end.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
...Yeah? And? I didn't say Elena is animated strangely. I just think visually she looks a bit different, is all. Nate looks a bit different as well, come to think of it. Can't quite pinpoint the differences, but I know I don't yet dislike them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Bitcher 3: Wild Cunt

It's a game about dealing with your exgirlfriend (yeah I know I changed two letters, I just thought it worked really well).

I'm not the best at video games but I manage. I'll put her up on easy mode and co-op games. I am certain she'll enjoy borderlands we both enjoy a little chaos and humor like that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're a fan of Lego games for co-op with your girlfriend I'd say get Lego Dimensions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is like a fucking pez Despenser, except instead of candy she spits out drivel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, what I am saying is that if she is playing Sims in Fallout 4 she should just play Sims, because it is better at those gameplay mechanics. That is why I said:

&gt; Which sucks because Sims is much better at that stuff.

Her bio is that she's a former pro starcraft player.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll have to show this to my girlfriend multiple times if she's EVER going to be able to play multiplayer 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Played Battleblock with my girlfriend too. Best pvp we've ever played
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't we already. Wow he's a lady killer... Or she is going to break so many hearts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My 60 year old mother is the best Tetris player I've ever met. Never really got into much else gaming wise, but she is still a cyborg at Tetris.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no girls player video games online, everyone is a man and/or pretending to be a girl for items
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her to remake that 64 to have the expansion pack slot!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hopefully an expansion pack for women comes out before then. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Terraria is a lot of fun to just relax and play. There is quite a bit of building, which someone starting out into gaming may not be too interested in, but especially after the most recent update, the game is a blast to play with a friend/girlfriend. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I enjoyed it at first, but it gets very repetitive very quickly.  You are either in a dedicated competitive group with a very specific set of heros and strategy or you are in a game with strangers who don't seem to know what they are doing.  I think it is fun if you are super competitive and know exact map layouts, meta, etc or a beginner who just has fun running around with Bastion.  Personally I got bored and moved to BF1 and Titanfall 2.  My daughter still plays and loves it though.  I'll hop on and play a couple rounds with her but wouldn't choose it if I was by myself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Punishing the truly skilled players is one thing. But it feels like she was able to be played by more than truly skilled players. I bet she'll still be able to be unstoppable with truly skilled players.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or she can just utilize the item storing/scrapping bug that lowers the size bar back down and allows you to keep building. This bug works on PC and consoles.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Set a ton of mines down where she's going to emerge from the ocean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know myself and that could be me, I would love a girl who knows finance, doesnt dislike gaming, looks decent, and is a good friend at the same time. 
Unfortunately they don't love me. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was like watching my girlfriend play and FPS, but I can't say anything because I want her to get into gaming.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would start with a low stress game to get her used to 3D motion, then work her way up to games that require 3D motion. Honestly, practice is the best way for her to get better. I guess it's hard to recommend anything because I grew up with a PS2, so I had 10+ years to be decent at 3D gaming.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Getting a girl friend is easier then setting that thing up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Used the crossbow against her healers, and leveled to 14 before trying again. It's still pretty hard
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife can't play first person games, as she gets [simulator sickness,](  which sucks for me that I can't play certain games with her that I'd like to.  We find other games that we enjoy together that aren't first person, like Starbound, Terraria, and the like.


A few things you can try include changing the POV angle in-game, turn off blur effects if they are on, and the linked article suggests a few things as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In my experience girls usually prefer consoles. I think it gives more of a videogame-ish feel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But still not easy enough to do a better job than OP's girl. 

either it's not as easy than you are making out, or she is better than you at something which requires no skill, which explains the salt. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her limit break was too op, she had to die.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're being willfully obtuse if you think lightsabers and women would have the same level of immersion breaking in a multiplayer WW1 game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Miz and Mayrse are far more A-list than whomever those girls are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the current highest level armor for a female paladin in WoW.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;I would suggest you put the video games up and start doing things she likes before you become a cuck!

But she said she wanted to learn..

isn't she a little bluer? or is this when she was an elf?


either ways very awesome

[If you finish the last quest in Heart of Stone before finding Ciri, Geralt can ask one of the NPC's where to find Ciri, but instead he'll give Geralt advice on how to save Ciri from an unnamed danger:
Making Ciri laugh when she feels defeated.
To allow Ciri to vent her frustration when she is betrayed.
When she wants to grieve a friend, that Geralt should grieve with her.
When Ciri is scared, Geralt should encourage her, but not act in her stead.
That Geralt never makes Ciri feel like he sold her out.] (/spoiler)


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was very disappointed when I didn't get to see Ciri fuck that farm boy who rescues her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I play this with my girlfriend every time she comes over. Quiz is absolutely our favourite and it all works really well! Love it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More like tell her this is a mainly first person game so you'll never see your character.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
fuck that ending though [she litterly rapes the main char in the ending fight scene](/spoiler)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At first I thought she wasn't human.. This is impressive.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're talking about children of prophecy. In order for one to become a Witcher you must have been touched by Destiny. If you agree to give a Witcher something you're not expecting, like a child, that marks that child by Destiny. It's mentioned in the Short Stories book 'The Last Wish' and its how (spoilers for the book) Ciri became a witcher, Geralt saved her parents. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I disagree, I abhor Karen Traviss's writing and think she did a disservice to the series. I tried to wade my way through the first book, the way she wrote action scenes just made them confusing and the dialogue was shit IMO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Later in the game he goes down there and talks to her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When geralt finds ciri in the witcher 3 and thinks she's dead 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah true, it's just potions and ointments IIRC. Remember the first quest in the the Witcher (1) where you needed to make the potion differently because she was allergic
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, this pales next to how she originally "seduced" him in the books.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who is the witch? Is she an evil witch or a good witch?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ya, she was killed by a few brutes that took them by surprise.  At this point I don't think they had encountered brutes before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agreed. I also loved the after main plot character stories. Chloe Valiens is one of my favorite tales characters mostly because of her arc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The last of Us is a masterpiece, and you should definitely try the DLC! IIRC, it's about Ellie's past with her bestfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, that's a good way to put it, the thing that makes me sad about it is the story telling between Luna and Noct.  The characters are well developed as far as I'm concerned, but their connection isnt.

It's like, "here's girl, you love her now, that's the story" 

I honestly felt more of a connection with iris or aranea.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I went back, fought the giant again, and un-banged her. That LSD cluster-cloud-fuck of a cutscene wasn't worth explaining to Triss later.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tim is the Robin in the series with Barbara appearing as oracle primarily and as Batgirl in a DLC
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The concept was great. There are still a ton of good scenes throughout the entire first season.. but it grew ridiculous with the romances. It felt like every girl Kirito encountered fell in love with him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hylia has been mentioned multiple times in multiple games....if anything she is the most mentioned goddess....I feel like it's more you haven't played enough games or explored the lore enough to understand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Different female bard that Geralt had a fling with in the books, Dandelion encouraged Geralt to go for it there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Japanese writers just love to take strong female characters and then break them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It started out really good, but then it just kind of fizzled out. When you decide what faction to side with, the rest of the game just seemed very forced. Not being able to make any choices that mattered was really annoying and felt quite degrading. Plus, what's the sole survivor's motivation after finding his/her son? That was the whole point to the story, so why are you compelled to continue after that?  
I'm a huge Fallout fan, and this game just left me wanting. I haven't even beat it because I can't motivate myself play it. The story had a lot of promise, and just falls short. It may be due to the lack of development through the surrounding side quests, as they don't have you do anything meaningful generally, but either way, the main story is not strong enough to stand on its own.  
I personally enjoyed the stories of Skyrim and FO3 quite a bit more, and intentionally did side quests to perpetuate the game and build the world for me. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel the same way. There are a lot of games where I could play the bad guy but in Bioshock I just can't bring myself to kill a little girl...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dunno, he seems to have the kidnapping down perfect, it's the keeping her part and fighting off invading plumbers part he's not so good at. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Demon souls will always have a special place in my heart but my god the story and backround of bloodborne was too much. I mean even the sidequest with the little girl had more story than most games main stories. Deep, epic, dark.

I haven't got far in DS3 yet, but the story is meh.... but the gameplay itself is great.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It also helps that this is one of the biggest games with a really well written female lead as well. It was a while since that happened.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well for starters you don't have to have Visas at all, you can kill her, and the characters hating each other is part of their story, there's specific reasons that they all don't really like each other part of their quests and back story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the biggest factor is that Geralt is very decent human being, Yennefer however gets her way no matter what. Even if it threathens others she tries to get what she wanted. Look up necromancy on Freya's garden.  Villagers didn't want the sorceress to do anything to the garden and there she goes and destroys every life in there and uses all the magic the place had for the corpse. 

I mean it was important and it set everything up and helped them find Ciri, but all of Geralt's lines had him going against it IIRC. 
With that said I think she's great however. I like that bitchy attitude, she's more sexy and more grown of the romance options.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are more then 3 endings since there are 3 or 4 different plot points each with a few possible endings. For ciri there is [3, she comes back and becomes a witcher with Geralt's help , she becomes empress , she is never seen again](/spoiler)  Each has a different epilogue. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
An RPG where you have to fuck monster girls to defeat them sounds... not that bad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm surprised I had to go this far down for a taki reference.  I loved her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
According to all the books story and plot lines and lore surrounding the game ciri by far out classes geralt by miles.. geralt has more experience and he is the star of the game so of course you're going to finish the game with him.. I can see ciri eventually having her own spin-off game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women in battle is just taking it too far 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My waifu had to find some kind of job after she retired from Square Enix
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Philippa was one of my favourite characters. 

Shame she appeared late game, all of her dialogue was excellent and of course, her actions in the Reason of State mission gave her that great bit of character development that meant, although you didn't really know her from W2, you kind of knew what to expect fro her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what's the reference, here... That is my name and she is one of my favorite characters...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, Triss' character has quite a bit of development over the course of the games. She pretty well realizes she's been incredibly manipulative of Geralt and feels horrible for it by Witcher 3. As opposed to Yennefer who's personality is essentially unchanged from the books.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah in some ways he is definitely a male fantasy.  He is a mutant super human, has an unnaturally long life, an expert swordsman, and can even fuck without a thought of STDs or knocking a girl up.  It's not really about Geralt's flaws, it's about how the world is flawed.  Because of this being a mutant is also his biggest flaw, despite trying to help people, he cannot be accepted.  It's super-hero-esqe, but I don't find it boring at all with how the world is presented.  It's kind of like a RPG with swords and magic version of superman.  I don't see how it's generic at all considering most RPGs are about how you're gonna save the world.  Geralt cannot save the world despite being exceptional at everything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking the same thing. It makes sense that they clapped when the woman tried to make a point, it's their show, but they also do it when Penn makes a point? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Too bad for him that he wasn't her final fantasy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Velvet Assassin is a last-gen stealth game *based* on a real female spy from WWII. I never finished it because I had other stuff going on, but it wasn't terrible from my recollection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You could kill her before the minutemen cone with you, skipping the possibility
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her ability lets her travel almost anywhere, could definite take a glimpse of another world, that is not a part of Witcher world at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chrono trigger!!!!! My favorite rpg as a young girl. Well second favorite FF6 forever!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks she finally managed to finish her science-based MMO after all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's exactly what a lot of people who only played the third one felt, and I think it was pretty brilliant that it was written that way.  Triss is focused purely on the moment, and unconcerned with what has happened before.

Yennifer is deeply embedded in the history between her and Geralt, and for much of the game they're sorting through mess that left.

It very much mirrors a player's experience who hasn't read the books or played previous games, and that's why you see that players new to the series pick Triss.  It also mirrors how Geralt can approach his loss of memory.  He can ignore the old memories, and focus on Triss or sort out his past with Yennefer.

That sort of thought put into things is why I think Witcher 3 is the best RPG I've ever played, probably the best RPG ever made.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just look at her eyes. She may be acting like she doesn't care, but she's got some plan deep down that she's determined to execute.

She used to want you dead but now she only wants you gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does it still lag when you fight the underworld lady?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did they really not check her pulse? Or did they check and thought they couldn't find one? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you think that she's a robot in the first place!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would the fire foam have killed her by itself as well? She coulda been dead by the time they ran over her...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The king may have orderd her into battle though. We may never know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife's name is Brenna, but she has always gone by her middle name. When people call and ask for Brianna or Brenda we know it is a telemarketer 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oo I bet she would like the south park stick of truth game after playing the walking dead one. Good suggestion!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's why I hog tie her and take her with me every time I see this happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The [music]( at the beggining of the game that played while she walks down the hallway, that scene was soo good for setting the atmosphere
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So maybe she walks or jogs it off instead ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had to check because I wasn't sure, no, her name is Kristen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The queen can be sacrificed, and the game continues even if she's off the board.

____________________ TOPIC 29 ______________________________

I need to talk to my wife

I can hear her now 

"Hey!, Listen!!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh, she's going to like you when she reads this
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus Christ. It's... so beautiful. I've ~~never~~ *barely* seen any women as pretty as this game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lady? What!? 😂 Who the hell talks like that? You sound weird as hell, man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's creepy and bound to jarring. I'm guessing of all the things that could make one go insane, sounding like a weird robo-female is definitely on the list.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How the hell does everyone here know who she is except me?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Glad to hear it! Let me know what she thinks!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I watched it without sound so I only saw your play and not what you were saying, but it just seems like you need to learn how to play with her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These women are utterly stupid, and if this is what we have got to contend with,... shit, we got a lot to do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of people think she was on ecstasy, explains why she wouldn't shut up. All the laughing too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You need to relax and stop being offended by a hilarious representation of a woman. I'd laugh if it was a guy and btw they're going to make ones with guys too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did anyone else realize it looks like she's giving it to Mario from behind?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
to quote imgur: 
"First time I've ever seen a girl surrounded by so many cocks on imgur. Surprised it hasn't been reported"

edit: since when did computers get autocorrect as bad as phones?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good thing they recorded this. Otherwise their girlfriends would never believe that it happened......... -.-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ok she can't get rid of her grand theft auto memories? now i don't believe this at all
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that voice different? It doesn't sound like the deadpan woman I'm used to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Anyone else think she has a really weird shaped thumb?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh yeah, that's Bridgette. I think she might be retarded.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every time my wife puts one of those on, I am hopeful that she will refrain from talking. And every time I am sorely disappointed when I hear these muffled noises emanating from her barely moving lips, with her obviously looking to start a conversation of which I have to guess words and sentences and interject with my usual banter and witticisms until she takes it off and I realize that I had forgotten that she talks like that normally
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus Christ that girl just can't shut the fuck up and just play the game can she?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey,  i know a lot of girls that can kill that course! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has just seen me play it and she knows nothing on it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It bothered me a little bit that she didn't pluck the string while turning the knob.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The one you want to drown in a well, not only for her shitty attitude but because of her haircut?  Jesus.  I'm sorry man.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh thats weird, I hear she's the one who created the video.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I haven't played in ten years and I heard it in her voice, too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean in into women who are into snowballing but i didn't mean it in the literal sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is there not a video without the scumbags just as bad as he is laughing at a woman who is obviously in pain?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If this was male actor and little girl all hell would break loose, especially women would be the loudest. 

But now, nothing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but that really doesn't explain lana's line about he flavor of the rare bone filling in her mouth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What are the names of the girl actors in the beginning?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One girl added me on skype just because I speak Spanish.

I mean. What I'm doing with my life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hear that she's insane? Is she insane? I HOPE SHES INSANE. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Maven Blackbriar: Taunts you as if she's invulnerable, which she is.

Let's just see how tough she acts once we flip that Essential flag to "No"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean chilling with Elon Musk in his mansion playing video games? Man, seems to me she's doing alright. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she really have nothing better to pointlessly whine about than video game asses?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's the point, he's NOT supposed to look like he was looking at her if this was real. it's supposed to look like he's staring at anyone who's watching him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can still hear the lamentation of their women.  That is best in life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey it's fanime! I go every year but I never saw her :/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Quite possible. I went with woman sounded to make sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
realistically only time she's useful would be an overtime cheese just like bastion, except with bastion there's a chance it'll work out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hey girl, you need a medic?"
"I got a pretty hard doc just waiting for you"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well no shit. But she wasnt suppose to have a British accent then either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sounds like that callous B got what she deserved...seriously, oh you tried to move to Skyrim? Off with you head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I asked her to tell them that when they were done playing with them in a few years to please give it back, but there was a falling out and they stopped talking. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's trying SO hard not to ruin the scene by laughing too much
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus! People have certainly been killed for less. Even if she doesn't like that stuff, she should definitely respect personal property.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a bit surprised that so many women take him at his word there, though. I mean, it's the obvious con.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she was being an asshole. I don't know the situation. Neither do you. We're both making assumptions about the situation. You want to blame the woman, have at it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she whine at you the whole time to stop ruining her life?

____________________ TOPIC 30 ______________________________

That reminds me of my brother and I playing FF6.

My older brother and I would play Super Mario World, Mega Man X and Sonic 1 and 2 a lot but I remember our minds being blown when our oldest brother brought home Final Fantasy 6 (3 at the time).

We would watch him play it for hours at a time, but were absolutely forbidden from playing it ourselves until he had finished with it. He was convinced we'd delete his save file and being 10/7 years older than us, we were pretty intimidated by him lol.

I remember a few weeks or something went by and he hadn't touched it so we decided he'd probably finished it. We threw the game in and never looked back. 

Eventually we were found out and I remember him trying to get mom to punish us but, she convinced him that we would be careful. And careful we were. I've accidentally deleted a lot of saves in my day but never that one. 

Funnily enough once our brother found out we were competent with the game he made us grind for him. Spent a loooooong time making sure everyone knew Ultima on his file.

Still my favorite game of all time, probably a nostalgia goggles but I replay it pretty often anyway.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Letting my neighbor borrow my Atari 2600 game "Enduro".  She moved away, took it with her, and I never saw it again.  I might add this was 1983 or so.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't want to evacuate my grandma. Can't she just drink prune juice?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I gave her a salad once and she went nuts for it. She gave me an ugly piece of wood in return. That's when I knew it was over
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Marry her all night long, if you know what I mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Excuse me kind sir, my female friend got together with Chad and I felt quite peeved.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After my grandma died I started up her game several months later, I wanted to see her village. I deeply regretted it after getting this message as she had played it shortly before she died. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Knew it was her as soon as I saw it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom did something similar to me, but she was really cleaver about it, she knew what systems we had and didn't have. So she bought us a bunch of gameboy colour games and gave those to us first, but me and my brother got the zelda orcale games and only had one game boy colour, but then she told us to look in the cupboard, 4 more gifts?  2 GBA's 2 more games we were ecstatic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she already knows deep down, but I do think she will find out *for sure* during Part 2, and I'm excited to see how that plays out !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Older folks like their prune juice; and there has been a rumor for a very long time that Dr. Pepper is made with prune juice.  It's not true in the least.  My Grandma thinks Bose stereos are the best in the world.  Nothing I can say will change her mind.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah that is totally where he is right now. Not aware of where his limbs are kind of. Accidently knocked his drink over at the dinner table last night. Very unbalanced when walking. I told his wife about the ankle weights and she said she will talk to his therapist. He just came home yesterday. Thank you!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can i hangout with your mom while she does mom stuff?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So only a female would make the mistake of trying to play a nes game on a snes?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I couldn't really get hooked to witcher. Idk if it got better later but I stopped when I met that girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One of the first things my girlfriend did when we got together was show me Titan AE. I knew then that she was the one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My daughter had just been born when I played that for the first time.  Needless to say I cried real hard and she slept in bed with mom and dad that night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I haven't visited a women's restroom since middleschool. I'm clean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
GIFs that end too soon :/

Did she get away from that zombie?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i knew i knew her - that's aubrey plaza! from parks and rec and earlier college humor (some time after this)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me too. I told my mom not to touch it and I had to leave it on until she could buy me a memory card. I only visited my mom's house on the weekends so my PlayStation was on for weeks until I got a memory.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The date was so boring, the game knew she was putting you to sleep!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's still people playing your grandma. Just fire her up and play her if you miss her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her how i play 8+ hours a day. 

Suddenly once a week doesnt look so bad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom is literally 20 feet away from me with 13 of her finnish friends, watching hockey.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had forgotten it existed until my mom had given me some stuff I left at her house all those years ago.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She knew what was going to happen if she stuck around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My college roommate and I eschewed all parties and women for basically two weeks while we played Riven.  WORTH IT.  I have never before nor since been as engrossed in a game, and finishing it was immensely satisfying.  I miss that stuff.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do the girlscouts really need to use Lures?

They could literally come to my house every month and i'd give them $20.  But they only show up once :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom is 55 and knows nothing about pokemon. Today she told me " I killed a pokemon today at work!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;I play in bed at night, usually after my wife is asleep, so I have to keep the volume somewhat low.

You play right next to your wife in bed while she's sleeping with the volume on? I'm impressed... I wear headphones when I'm playing in the next room from the sleeping SO
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly this.  I saw a post a few weeks ago where people actually didn't realize that the name wasn't pronounced the way she is using it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember thinking surely they'll revive her or bring her back somehow. Then she gets sent off. 😭
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My most important Pokemon Memory is pretty recent and rather sad. As a kid I always played Pokemon together with my mom. We would always by both games and each of us played one. 6 years ago I moved out and 600km north so my mom and I didnt see each other very often. Mom had stopped playing pokemon by then. I think the last game she played was Heartgold. Then my mother got diagnosed with cancer. She had therapy and everything and it was said that she has many years to live. Sometime in this period she tells me she bought a 3ds and Pokemon X after I told her how much I loved Pokemon Y. My mom sadly died to cancer November of last year after fighting it for like 5 years. As I last seen her she told me that if she dies, she wants my fiance to have her 3ds. So I opened her 3ds because I wanted to look at her Pokemon, how far she has gotten etc. Turns out she had only 2 badges which made me sad, the game gets better after the first 2 badges. Then, when I looked at her team, I saw she picked charmander as her Kanto starter (propably because it was my favorite, she loved squirtle) and then i saw her Kalos starter. She picked froakie (the same starter I picked this time) and the nickname of her froakie was my name. I immediately had to cry and transfered her team over to my copy and keep with me as a memory of playing with my mom when i was younger. Her froakie has a special place on my game and I will forever keep him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm so happy I finally get to play Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us while the misses and her kid are away at her mom's. I've felt like I waited too long to play but seeing all these posts where you guys are just starting out makes me happy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My sister told me about this a while ago, I've been tormenting her with it ever since
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is all I remember about my gamegear.  I played it for about a month until my mom said she wasn't going to buy batteries for it anymore.  That was a sad day.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember going to toys r us with my mom the day this came out or a few days after, and being so distraught because oddworld Abe's exodus was also out and I really wanted that game too! I guess she saw that it really was a tough choice for me and she decided to get me both as a surprise!
That was really awesome
One of my favorite gaming memories.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We be broke one pretty quick and her dad got another, but as it turns out when we broke that one the original one still worked. This game wasn't that rare back then. Its just because it wasn't good that people didn't hold onto it. Just like ET
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she was probably late 20's early 30s, how old are you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No no. You go to the house of the friend that has the hot sister. That way when she walks by his room you can all tell him you want to fuck his sister. Makes for a jolly ribbing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd play this game with my dad all the time when I was a kid. My mom ended up giving it to her friends husband because she got sick of us getting pissed off at the game. 

Little did I know I wouldn't beat the game until 8 years later. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved that game! Even got my ex to play it, guess it wasn't hard since she already played farmville. Gave it up because it took to much off my time and didn't feel rewarding in the end. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw a girl did this, don't remember where it was. Not oc
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember when I was young and I used to make my mom walk the Nintendogs when I went out. I remember her getting really angry when I bought another dog on it because she said I couldn't look after the first one yet. And *now* she tells me I take games too seriously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I second this, i bought it for my nongaming girlfriend to play together and she wouldn't let me go to sleep because she was enjoying it so much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Great memories with this game. My roommate in college would come and watch me play late at night and we would both scream like little girls until the RA would come and told us to shut up.

Too bad DS3 wasn't nearly as memorable. I didn't hate the game, but it felt like just another dark shooter. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My niece is 13. I remember the day when she asked us at family dinner what 9/11 meant. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what is going to happen when all those guys show up and realize that not a single girl is there?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wasn't talking about him/her. I was talking about the people who I said were "freaking out."

I love this game but after studying medicine I ruin it for myself to realize she would be dead at the first to second blow, much less stand while taking the rest of it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Interesting that the MoCap is mirrored left/right. Is she left handed and the character right handed?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Have you tried giving her a keyboard and mouse so she wouldn't have to game like a savage?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she's trying to tell you that you can never leave... Not even once
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My GF is completely gaming illiterate, she struggled to comprehend one thumbstick controls your legs, the other your head etc. Working on training her though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sort of. It's also a euphemism for raping a woman in colorado.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and here I am messing her up.  

* HER: turn left up here
* ME: turn left, right
* HER: right
* ME: wait what I am turning left, right
* HER: just fucking turn left



had to put a ring on it



welp cant format I guess
nevermind I can
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think you might be the best girlfriend ever...other than mine, who is sitting right next to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why not have her use mouse and keyboard rather than a controller?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but look at the control room girl shitting herself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She works in an office doesn't she? Some day youre going to come home with all your shit packed up and you two are moving to a farm!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I HAVE THIS EXACT TV in my little girls room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Your friend Donna killed a man?"

*unintelligible sounds*

"I don't think we can spare the money to bail her out. And what if she kills you?"

*Girlfriend proceeds to flip me off*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would hang the shit out of that in my room!! Nerdy girls are the best !!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cause she tooooooootally didn't just hand the controller to someone else
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that... is that Kim Jong Un sitting next to the little girl or am I just seeing things?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, my wife doesn't *let* me do anything, nor does she *not* let me do things.

Your girlfriend is awful and controlling. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All you'd have to do to kill her would be leave a bunch of poison berries laying about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh.

Well, I didn't know this in advance, and left her corpse in a corner of the basement. Seemed kinder at the time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There goes what was left of any millennials backing her.  MAGA
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should have her try to use mouse and keyboard, that might be more strait forward
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you stop looking at all the girlfriend simulators a so often they should at least show up less often in your queue
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really liked how the name of my girlfriend on my ankle turned out but she left me and here we are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does your wife know you are cheating on her with your right hand? 
When was the last time you had a romantic evening with her? I'd imagine she would be absolutely livid if she found out. :p
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine what the touch of a woman feels like. You'll never know if you think video game funerals are anything but idiotic. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless she's peeing in the lemonade, all the food poisoning os on Frito-Lay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn! And and got to sleep in her room, how dear.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was pretty sure he was about to rape her, since that would be the most horrific thing that could happen to her without killing her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1. Is that a bed? 2. Why is there so much food paraphernalia in the bed?.... maybe you should've have got her a blender!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know! I actually got every piece but the primer to her on this very run, using the grappling hook. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why didn't she play with a keyboard and mouse like a normal person?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She probably has no idea what she's wearing bc it's not a protein drink
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like its just there to hang in front of her instead of putting it on the floor or her lap.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believe so. That's probably why she has what looks like irradiated hands. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What?  The break is what killed her.

Never stop playing, folks, your life may depend on it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait til you see what she does for him once he breaks both of his arms.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, [she's okay]( I guess.  If you're into that sort of thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't, it's every man/woman for him/herself.  Run around until all the sticks are empty.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she just got done murdering multiple people i think itd be normal to have shakey hands...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why oh why didn't you put it on her head! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Got some hydroponics on that farm of yours, I see. Just keep it in the greenhouse, if this girl knows what grass smells like the whole hood might catch on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was waiting for the girl to get raped and/or beaten.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless you know who that is, you're not ready for her nudes. 

____________________ TOPIC 2 ______________________________

Honestly if I married Dolce it'd be because Pico is dope AF.

Forte still best girl though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mario has tons of girls around. Pauline, peach, daisy. The 3 of them are in one of the 3ds mii plaza puzzles together. Iirc, Pauline is still in some recent games, and was in Game boy dk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the wife playing the vive or the vive playing her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's a reference to smash bros since she recently became a character
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, people think it's her but it hasn't been confirmed
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure if that was the reason she was included though. They had all the Clinton's in the game:Bill, Hillary, and George
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right there, lying to Geralt, using his amnesia against him. Manipulating him and using his love for Yennifer as a trick to get him to love her instead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Triss is where it's at. Always choose her over Yen myself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you don't have to worry about whether she loves you or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So if you choose Morinth in ME2, you'll have to kill her in ME3?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yoshi's her favorite so it was obviously her first choice.  I chose last and had to pick up the slack on there not being any Peach.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't Miranda introduced in ME2? Why would she be introducing herself in ME3? Something's fishy...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Clinton supporters: "I'm with her!"

Trump supporters: "Make America Great again!"

What's more appealing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mai is seeming to be my bane, I fucking *hateeeee* Mai, and I will do anything I can to fucking destroy her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her defense I find her facial expressions to be very on point for Triss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mass Effect or should I say mass erect. Amirite ladies?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is what happened when I bought my wife a Wii U and Mario Party. Now she cant stop making levels and playing Mario Party
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"at least she's not as bad as Trump"  
What a campaign slogan, I feel so good about this election.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
underrated considering they shoehorn her into every possible game they can? (Mario Kart 8, Mario 3d World, Super Smash Bros)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She is really good at Mario Kart but she has terrible motor skills. She has shown an interest in Smash Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. so I think I might get her started on some handheld games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Super Mario World with my mom on her Super Nintendo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't have a source, but iirc this isn't actually what she said. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or you could say she's turning into a Super Saiyan!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you choose her as president you're fucked Americans. Just sayin 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the female Krogan is only in Mass Effect 3?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she doesn't have a ps3 the the move won't work. I would suggest getting the Wii though, thebps3 doesn't have many motion games. Where the Wii has a lot, the Wii also has some good motion controlled games, silent hill, Mario galaxy, xenosaga.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you, Mario, but your ladyfingers are in another castle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to see her as Arkum Harley Quinn. Her facial expressions are on point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought she tells them the whole contract. Eh, still more efficient than Astrid, who basically learns of contracts through rumors. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. The guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Naw, she hasn't even tried it. I think she's turned off my the name. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It terrifies me that it looks like the choice for the next president be between her and trump. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you do the same thing with Mario party?  

Edit: thanks for the answers! I'll have to pick it up so me and my girlfriend can play. We love Mario party for N64 so this will be perfect. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs me vs the guy she tells u not to worry about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it gets her to stop talking about my destiny....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Personally, my favorite tagline from her was "I'm the only one who can defeat Trump."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No you wouldn't. You would smash if she was 64.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But I won right after my girlfriend won once, it was super bizarre 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her facial expression is like she's about to do a GDP vid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe I just got tricked into watching a lemon party. I guess I should be on the lookout for tubgirl or goatse or something next.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My thought too.. Mario never, not once, says she's in another castle. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I take her over the manipulative bitch that Triss is. I can never pick her over Yen 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His girl likes to LAN party all the time  
LAN party all the time  
LAN party all the tiiimmme.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean if she says no then it's definitely no, but she won't say no......because of the implication. 

____________________ TOPIC 3 ______________________________

It made my day. If I were a girl, I would PM you my tits.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she freak out when she sees the altar or no? I've never actually thought about taking her there to see what would happen. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sucks for him that he will only be her best friend
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i'm wondering how she thought that was going to work to be honest
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
my buddy got engaged to his girlfriend on 11/11/11 at 11:11. They just got divorced.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldnt mind taking her down mid, if you know what I mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
oh, but i do like kleo, she is just my kind of girl!


(would never dare to say otherwise)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yes its Emilly Kalldwin, the girl whose Corvo was saving from that guy which i forgot the name. Lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't Starve Together. My fiancé doesn't like video games a whole lot, but she loves to play that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yes you are right but who can tell her i will show this to her thanks she don't know gaming is life :p
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That doesn't entitle you to actually do so. If she makes it hard to rip something, then DON'T RIP IT.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Find a woman who stays in the kitchen that way you can play all the fucking games you want.  #lyfehacks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh yes she did!

Oh no she di'int!

Oh yes she did!

Oh no sh--

*YES SHE DID PETER, I JUST SAW HER!!*

Alright joe take it easy...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, you wouldn't. Since she would probably never let you near her lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she knows how to knit and not crochet I think. And I don't understand all that much about either, so I'll ask her what she thinks. But thanks for the heads up!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll take the downvotes but... dump her, this is never going to work out for you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had her get rehabilitated so now she doesn't anymore and gets pissed when I do in front of her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you wanna be the very best, like no one ever was, you gotta make some sacrifices. Like having a Pokemon hating girlfriend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah the good old days - put that little girl in her very own kitchen, lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sure his future girlfriend's gonna love him trying to move that into the apartment. 

"Oh, hell no."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wtf?  No.  Best game I've ever played in my life.  My wife also played it, and she hates video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to believe that girl at the end stayed to "thank" him
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm parsing it as "PM me tits, m'lady!"

It's Neckbeard the Pirate.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; the obsidian teeth in her vagina

oh hell no
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks, she tries hard to get what she's looking for.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now let's see her without all the nerd shit... her pussy :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"ooh, she's gonna do a superhero landing, really impractical, really hard on your knees" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your friend doesnt happen to be a "she" in VT, does it?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who is the girl everyone uses in these triggered memes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was 11 I believe, her in game models for the early games were always a thing of nightmares.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah yes, this picture again. Of all the pictures in her album, it's always this one that gets reposted.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you for this, thank you! I didn't know about her before this. Thank you!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They did?! You wonderful man/woman, thank you for telling me! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And he tried really really hard not to take her lol 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the idea that all men hate all women is cemented in their mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Girlfriend did, but yes.
In total it took her 11 hrs of painting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thank you so much dude, i've been looking for her for a while now. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should have let you kill that bitch either way. Hadvar (it was hadvar right?) could have just been like "never liked her anyways"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a girl who games and I'm neither of those. Thanks for trying I guess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok thanks I think I'll have her try this one then. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
hell yeah! That first pic is perfect. I like my girls with a little meat on em... always have
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gee, I wonder why women wouldn't feel comfortable on reddit...

Tone it down a notch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
women just need shit to bitch about.  Same shit happens to men but no bitching... hrmmmm
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried minecraft already and she cant do it very well. Plus she can't move and look at the same time yet so i need to find some way of easing her into 3d...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Oh sweet I get to kill this bitch too."

Pretty sure she's a serial killer by that point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What makes you pretty sure? Looks like a she to me.

Not saying it definitely is, but I can't tell from that picture that it isn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh she's not my girlfriend she's just my bottom bitch. Do you know what I am saying 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, I saw her at both cons too. She was also promoting a comic they had made. I think it was called Nuka Girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah yep. But she is like "YOOO is there *anything* you could give me to help??" 

That was a tough one I forgot about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks! Yeah I agree, when my wife played she was a bit shocked!

____________________ TOPIC 4 ______________________________

actually if u look her video she run 90% of time. ye it was suprisingly strange to see with that build. but it works for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Normally what I do is turn towards the girl and scream, "INTERCOURSE!"

Around the third or fourth time screaming it they come around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got instant 2 hearts with her by giving her cookies.

I found them in a trashcan.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ever bug so far as been cosmetic only for me like ellie not having a head for 1 second, i was talking to nick and ot swtiched over to her for like one line
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just ran in with Uthgerd, and promptly lost her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she hacked him any harder, walnuts would have dropped out of his mouth. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How do you think she made that 1600 gold while he was away...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
wasnt that Nick? When he got the girl back he made beeping noises
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, he did a very slight drop from where that lady is sitting. He didn't do that much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
bit further in that building lays a skeleton with a pen stuck in her neck
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She also has her ulti whoch is to place a bomb 0__0
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
None of my female friends have decided to show me their genitals before. Am I missing out or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks fantastic, but I can't stop looking at her boomerang eyebrows.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When did Hank Hill turn into a disgruntled old woman?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
/throws flashlight at him and runs off screaming like a little girl.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know, there's a way you can keep her from turning 8 but... Nah, it's not for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how one of the guys she is talking to all of a sudden just decides to run like hell. He knows that dude isn't normal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fly her out to you, then when you're playing she can give head
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about that huge window she runs towards? If she were facing to the right just a bit more, she'd have ran right through it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just so happens in the 2nd game you fuck her back
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I personally just liked stabbing little girls but whatever works for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A land down under, where women glow and men plunder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
gotta wander what happened on the other end, he had grabbed and yanked it down to buy time to unclip, wonder how much her face got mushed up to the doors on the other side
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, you know, she also has a third eye inside of her head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the girls face. She's all "awh jip I lost." But she's still having a blast. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is normal. Just tell someone who works there to open her up for you.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep that move away from female trainers. That Shiny Wailord looks like a massive dildo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The blood was actually from a cut on her forehead, you can see it near the end.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you squint your eyes after injecting yourself with krokadil, she kind of looks like a Mold Demon 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend just yelled out "DOUBLE PENETRATION" when that happened
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same. The video was getting close to the end and i started panicking thinking she wasnt going to find it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Which could be why we didn't see his face. He was just an angel or a figment of her imagination. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she tells you she's wet so you bring protection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
According to other posters, it does appear to be chastisement, and also happens when you get very close to her chest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
also there is blood running down from her head (trauma?) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dark Souls 1, just tell her to go to Burg, not to that goddamn graveyard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Give that woman a coat ! She must feel cold already
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a mustache so I guess I'm halfway there. Also I'm a woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she could have ran right through that window/door thing there and possibly put a crack in the glass on the headset
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Buddy you missed some great episodes.

That is from the Byzantium in season 5, Amy can't open her eyes because she has a weeping angel in them (jumped out of a TV into her eye and if she opens them, she'll possibly turn into one) and she's walking through a forest full of weeping angels pretending like she can see when she trips over a root. Then that angel instead of you know, zapping her back in time cranes it's head around making the angels way less terrifying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same thing with half life 2. Alyx would put her hand in front of her face as soon as you shined your light on her face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Got a 970 after 4 years of 560Ti, so good and such a jump, very nearly got the 980Ti but my girlfriend would have castrated me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw a Pharah fly over a wall, send a Junkrat flying, landed and saluted as he fell past her. It was fantastic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not necessarily... she could've just ran off and went through with it and he followed her.

Maybe she found out what they wanted to do to her or somethinf like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You need to sneak up and reverse pickpocket her. Equip your D, and place it in her inventory. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she was already in a thong on the plane. All she did was take off her stockings.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


Mercy's real name is Angela Ziegler, and she's a 37 year old Swiss medic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine how much faster she would be if she equipped the knife.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how she decided to take his one possible ledge grab if falling.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yes it's clear you can see her skid on the ground as the door flies

It's not a dick, don't take it so hard lady. Goddamn.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's already in the pics above. My guess, in VI we'll find out that she pierced.

Just sayin'.... [her front]( is pretty nice too!

It's [alllllll]( nice!

____________________ TOPIC 6 ______________________________

OP does she have prints of these?? These would make a killing...I would definitely consider having some prints made to sell.

15 yr old girl is Paralyzed! *zrrt* 15 yr old girl can't move!

29 yr old here. Weeping cause mom sold my Sega Genesis for 20 bucks when her and my grandma decided they were having a yard sale. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Acceptable? They're just selling a product, it's up to the customer to decide if the product has any value for him/her. If not, just don't get it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
how does that not make her a gamer? i started when i was roughly 3 years old and i'm still playing them. how can you not call her a gamer?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And she spend half a year there. So easily enough time to give us some quests in Cyberpunk 2077.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, they could back in 2005 when she made that speech.

These days about 80% of retailers (give or take a few) has policies against selling M-rated games to kids, but back then it was only around 20% or so.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't say I didn't like it.  I just think that she could have spent that money better elsewhere.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not sure I understand though considering bills are always a lot less than your income...say you make $50K, she makes $500K, and your bills are $10K. You pay $909, she pays $9091. You now have $49K and she has $491K.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my coffee, I don't like coffee. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the fuckin' way she goes and erections, ruined the fuckin' Squanch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
2 or more years. The only time she makes videos is to ask for money. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's precious. Least she pays attention to what you like :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gamer guys these days are so lucky.  In my day gamer girls were so rare.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet because of the way DDR scoring works she might get a better score.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would pay premium pornography prices to see her in some porno.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've checked around, and it seems so.

But I'd love to hear what they consider "gamer", and I really don't think "PC gamer" are almost 50/50. In all the people I know and played with those last few years, maybe 20% were women, and they were all 20+ years.

As you said, could be wrong though :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Deapite spending much less money. This is probably like her husband spending a fraction of a cent on her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her to sell them on Etsy.  She will have tons of orders.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course gsme stop wouldn't buy it. They probably offered her 10 bucks and half a used cigarette 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Holy shit no. Those stats are for MMOs. I'm pretty sure you consider those who play FPSs or fighters, ect to be gamers, right? SO no. That study isn't saying shit about the amount of female gamers out there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You did give her more money though right? You at least let her know how much it's worth and didn't just snatch it up right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or sell them for what they're worth and tell her you got 60$. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gamer girls - good from far, but far from good.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll definitely try to convince her. It's worth a shot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would glady give them $40 for MWR. I will not give them $80 for MWR and the shit show that is IW.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely not legit in Bali, last time the girl with the herbs in surfboard bag got 10 years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yup, it's one of the few games that made my girlfriend bug me to play it! 10/10
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How much would it cost to buy one like this from your girlfriend?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife makes about 45k more per year than I do. All our money goes into a joint account, we add some to savings, and spend what we want of the rest. Some months I spend more and some months she does. I agree with you that it seems silly to say "You can only spend X amount of money and the rest is mine!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She wouldn't put out because she was gamer 4 lyfe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe you should do that for him and he will spend more time with you instead of her 🍻
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No? We don't? We need to stop politicizing this shit and just buy the games we like and not buy the games we don't. Zoe Quinn isn't worth our time; forget her and move on.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Watch what you drill. I just spent five minutes drilling my girlfriend, and i also got a sandwich!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When you're married there is no more his money or her money. There's just money and bills that need to get paid. Sometimes hobbies take the hit so you can have electricity and food in the fridge. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then 20 minutes passed and she was then again pissed. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Congrats, making a non gamer into a gamer or at least have them understand the hobby is something I've never been successful with women my age (34). 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that "someone" was being a dick and they decided that he or she will get a cheap sweaters instead. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So here is the thing... she made that speech in 2005... back then you could buy *M* rated games if you were under *17* with no penalty.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Likewise, I would definitely be interested in buying one if she decides to make more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I'm in the lower half of the crowd who still thinks she'll regret it. She still might love pokemon at 60, but I have doubt. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she sell prints?  I have a friend that would absolutely love this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, pretty fucked up considering they did all that to a 12 year old girl.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So you make 4x as much as your wife, but you 50/50 the bills? Of course you don't resent her. She might resent you though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned for Sega.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's been 10 years old for 15 years. He still thinks girls are icky
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl doesn't need to be any closer to food. All ~~she~~ it needs are a ton more chromosomes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're specifying you're a "female gamer" chances are you either aren't or want something from people lmao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can see the chart without paying anything. Just close the popup. 

If you still can't see it, then it says that men make up 52% of mobile gamers while women make up 48%. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
SO worked for them, I know how frivolously they spend money as she was typically the one who finalized purchases for that location.

____________________ TOPIC 7 ______________________________

&gt;lol women don't want to be coal miners.

For some reason this is a completely acceptable answer, but you can't say "women just don't want to be scientists/game developers." That's completely unacceptable to say.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, sometimes she would call me at work to ask questions about the game....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 No, it isn't. But the numbers are definitely in her favor!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True enough. Theres that one male that combines with the female and like melts into her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, I should. I think girls should game, as well. But the question wasn't asked based on my own opinions. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
looks like she had to carry the source for her reference around so she could explain what she was
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not guaranteed, but possible. Lighter and less frequent at least. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
PSA: If you feel like this girl and find yourself losing to VR, or gaming, or anything else, it's not a sign of your partner having an issue. It's a sign that you're dull as fuck so step your game up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why was he not using the visor? Missing a significant part of the VR girlfriend experience with that setup. 🤔
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about it is political?

The video shows a clip of the then senator(?) stating video games make kids violent and then shows evidence that she is wrong. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Could you ELI5, why can't you combine birth data and risk/chance of suprise labour to get the amount of women per day?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is not saying that Pontiff is the quickest Bossfight in general. He means in her Speedruns the Pontiff takes the least time, that's why it's used for gifs. She also does him Blind from time to time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would explain her state in the two following games, yes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, she may not actually feel that way as she likely just repeated it when she noticed it polled well, like most of her positions. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One might notice the distinct lack of females of the species...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. People nowadays have no idea how to properly treat a woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hand writing analysis finds that Bubble-shaped letters, lack of angles, generally points to someone who speaks freely and is kinder than average. Cutesy loops might relate to a decent level of creativity, emotional openness, open-mindedness, and imagination. common traits and social behaviors of females

While on the other hand smaller edgier handwriting relates to the following:
intensifies strengths; modesty; ability to concentrate; detail oriented; possible mental aptitude; may be willing to listen; reflective; lacks major concern for attention; cautious nature. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife has minor number dyslexia and [directional confusion]( so her as the navigator SUCKS. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All you need is the VR then you can have a VR girlfriend 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, she changes her stance so often, no point looking to the past to see what she's all about now
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a girl who likes games this is a valuable question. For the most part I don't have any patience for games where I can't play a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Breaking rule 6 of r/gaming ? Is she being given away? Where do I enter
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Call it whatever you want, been in a relationship for almost 5 years with my girlfriend. I'm not seeking for anything. Just have respect, but it's hard to come by these days.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She needs a Little Rascal with handicap tags and she'd be set.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
does she like, realize she's in *virtual* reality? as in not real. doesn't seem like the most intelligent person tbh.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, the question is if she'll realize and accept that or not for our case....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In her mind a movie is passive and in a video game you actually have to do the violence. Explain to her tool use and move out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Also as sidenote, in what world does "I don't understand social cues and social norms" = I'm gonna kill people?

I can't believe she is making this accusation!!

And it's a slippery slope towards it's the "lack of religion" in this country that leads to violence. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, she never said it was a note 7
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I'd like a source too, [it's not on her official bio.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What you're missing is that answering "yes" causes her to remain friendly, answering "no" cause her to turn hostile. Given that she wants you to leave the grave of Artorias alone, her reactions to the possible responses are the wrong way around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you want to understand the root of the dynamic between men and women, this is it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't pass the beschell test though. Almost all her interactions are with men.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So women are disabled? Do you think women are incapable?

I don't go into an office and say "We need waaaaaay more blind people" so why do you such a thing with women?

Hire based on merit, which is exactly how it works now (minus Affirmative Action which is active discrimination).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If my puppy has taught me anything it's that her value only increases with time.

(and that it's possible to get lost in a blanket) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Call her friend adorable. It seems less threatening to your SO generally, and sounds better than saying "yes" or obviously avoiding the question. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've eaten my fair share, and never has one been dirty.  No girl would ever risk that.  I imagine they boil/scrub/bleach/rinse/repeat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair it could be a [cigarillo]( Although with snoop I'm not that convinced
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You really think how good he is at video games affects his chances with women? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because, generally speaking, the majority of people are straight. Which means it's a woman speaking about her SO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fair enough, was just saying that you can quite clearly see her back side 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I assume you offered her creamer like a gentleman, yes?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Punisher warzone was directed by a woman who played Kitana in alive action show
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depending on what decisions you make near end-game, her stubbornness was needed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm well aware of these things.  I'm also aware that using common sense would lead one to the conclusion that these things are perpetrated by men far more often than they are perpetrated by women and pretending like that's not the case doesn't help anyone.

Suicide is obviously a different conversation.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't have to share all the same interest in life with your partner but they do have to respect your interests. She likely doesn't respect your gaming because she sees it a solitary activity for kids. Think of ways to show her that this isn't the case.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would actually probably be a little painful.
As a transwoman, I'm heavily inclined to avoid VR games where you're a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She had someone looking over here? You act like she can even exactly understand the scope of things
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, actually, it isn't. She wants you to leave the grave of Artorias alone, but if you answer that no, you're not here for the grave of Artorias, she'll get pissy. The question present in the dialog is not the question we are answering, it is in fact the opposite of it.

You have failed the test. Thank you for proving my point that the dialog is unintelligible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The real question is, does anyone have a picture of her getting fucked?

____________________ TOPIC 8 ______________________________

congrats now you know how the rest of us feel when they cast a Scot to play an Egyptian and cast a white girl to play a Japanese person...This is where you get the answer the rest of us minorities get...get over it. 


Feel better Now? No, I know you don't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This woman is beautiful but Laura Croft had two predominant features that she doesn't appear to have.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
81% of women prefer an average guy with sausage fingers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right?  I would be SO stoked if I found one.

If you're having a bad day, little things like this can make a huge difference.   What she's doing is wonderful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She definitely does that cos play boob job thingy to make it look like she's got it tits.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't that the one where batgirl and Batman banged? Weirdos me out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me and my friend always said [she has one boob bigger]( than the other.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apparently she was pretty or had some pretty large physical features
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess boobs are boobs not matter what the woman looks like
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that just means you're going to ***gloss over*** what you're really doing and not call it by its name: 

* ***defining the 'right way' of depicting women*** 

:shrugs: 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They really didn't get much bigger. Like I said she was probably a B-cup on X-2.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
stop hoarding all those fat women to yourself, geez talk about slefish
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My point is not to refute the point entirely. My point is that it's hardly fair to say 'male athletes are conventionally attractive and female athletes aren't'. There are more than a few counterexamples. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
White? She looks like she is made up of all sorts of ethnicities. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was also nice how the other people weren't shoehorned in **because** they were black/female/asian, etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's perfectly normal to be attracted to a 16 year old girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the 2013 Tomb Raider, she also had D's, not B's.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I find it interesting how you know her exact size...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not a big deal or anything but the Dancer is female.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I *am* a heterosexual female, so her boobs do nothing for me.  :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What you never seen a woman with a penis before?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If there wasn't a girl there, how would you know he wasn't gay?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well I wouldn't go so far as to call her a slut just for showing a bit of midriff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just some people really want her to be gay, like that is what defines her in the game or something. I'll still like her no matter her preference I think she's a total badass regardless.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More like, "that strong female lead character we tried to butcher in Other M?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What should we call this game about a lady who raid tombs?
Tomb raider.
What about the sequels?
Tomb raider.
But we...
TOMB. RAIDER.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, if you do it as a white girl you just ending becoming Asuka.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In reality girls do have a hard time with their large tits
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why's it gotta be a she?

Maybe this person's girlfriend is a transitioning penis to no penis with an unassigned gender role!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't mind being flashed in real life, but she'd have to be fairly attractive
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it weren't for make-up, Asian women would have a really hard time getting boyfriends.

This girl doesn't really have any make-up on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
THIS, she looks way more like T2 Sara Connor than Lara Croft. I think it's the Aviators. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's got pretty big ones even for her size, and I would take her over the other :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought is was supposed by calling her fat. But is seems to mean calling her phat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm really into cookware. 

Although some people also use it to mean attracted to people of all genders. Man, woman, trans, etc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how tired she is of tomb raider jokes?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Men aren't fighting for actual representation in games. For every non average dude in games, there are average looking men. Women though were always being sexualized. 

Look at Lara Croft, strong woman character but they still sexualized her. Compare her to a similar character like Nathan Drake who isn't. Nathan Drake as a character looks like a very fit dude, something some average person could actually look like. 

Representation is a lot more important than people realize. These are the factors driving culture.

The Tomb Raider reboot Lara Croft is the sexiest looking char I've ever seen in video games. 

The sequel Rise of the Tomb Raider Lara doesn't look as alluring and sexy. Looks more like a run of the mill middle aged woman. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ITT: The one time people aren't talking about how attractive the girl is cosplaying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ehh her tits are too small to be cosplaying. Pretty girl though 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a euphemism, it's not gender biased. But congratulations on being female. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd also like more nudity. Preferably women with big tits and hairless kittens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Uhh Tomb Raider is just Uncharted with a female, the tomb raider remakes are almost nothing like the originals, there's a reason MS paid for this to be exclusive so they'd have an answer to Uncharted but it backfired because Uncharted was delayed and Tomb Raider came out next to Fallout 4.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it the one where she's swinging the tennis racquet? She looks a bit larger than usual in that one too, I would think.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Big difference between classified and confidential. And yet, after a lengthy investigation by the FBI she wasn't indicted. By definition she isn't a criminal. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am one of those women. That's why I'm confused about her voluptuous breasts and teensy nips.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't understand why straight men like to see attractive women in revealing clothing?

That is a tough one...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess. It'd be better if she actually had breasts
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No it doesent... She looks like she has a normal amount of muscle and quite a lot of fat.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know.

She just has that "undeniable" beauty to her,you know?

Take Megan Fox. She's definitely not unattractive. Many are attractive to her. But there's also people who are not attracted to her.

____________________ TOPIC 9 ______________________________

She never said she was special, but just in your statement you acknowledged she was getting harassed in a different way because she's female. So yes, she is getting treated different for being female and it's stupid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wendy Williams is a fucking idiot, I have no idea how she has a show.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Excuse me? Listen here you Cis White Male. You don't understand our daily struggle. You also said "She", How about some gender neutral pronouns?!? They did not even once, mention that Tracer identifies as a female. Don't you dare try to take them from our struggle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, fine. But the question of what equality between non-identical groups actually entails is not trivial, and there's no obviously correct answer to it anymore than there's an objective answer to what is just.

It's stupid to use radical feminists to bash other schools of feminism who disagree with them on the matter in question - not that it ever has or will stop this sub - but it's not so easy to credibly claim they're not feminists in the first place. There are perhaps people we can credibly dismiss as non-feminists despite their protestations otherwise - an extreme example, a serial killer than murders and rapes only women - but one of the well established schools of feminism isn't so easily disposed of.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure Sarkeesian will look past this game on her venture to expose sexism in games.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Excellent.  I assume that we agree on [the only acceptable dress]( for women from now on in video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;i'm just saying that there's no way to declare that someone is representative of all of feminism when there are so many conflicting schools of thought that often have ideas that are mutually exclusive. no one person can encompass all of feminism without being self-contradictory, you're oversimplifying things

I mean sure, it's not 100%, but "Tropes in our media often reflect the subordination of women in society" is just about one of the most conventional, non-controversial feminist statements you can make. All Anita's done that's new is look at video games and present her conclusions in a layman-friendly way. Her views themselves are very very unremarkable from a feminist standpoint. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used the quotes as a way to be sarcastic, sorry if that wasn't clear. But yes I agree with you, this game objectifies women and it's stupid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agree to disagree then. I hold firm in the belief that the American people are ready for a truly liberal candidate like Bernie. 

I will say this, though: the Bernie supporters that didn't vote for Clinton are not to blame. The DNC and Hillary have no one to blame but themselves. You say she made concessions. Not nearly enough to offset the constant right-wing shift she was doing. Besides that, it's their fault that she was even the candidate to begin with. We all know that she basically stole the nomination away from Bernie. Whether it was all through legal means or not is up for some discussion, but if Bernie got the nomination (which, by all rights, he should have done), there's no doubt in my mind he'd have not only beaten Trump, but absolutely trounced him into the fucking ground.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used this argument with dudes claiming real MRAs aren't misogynists recently and was met with downvotes. I am an egalitarian and therefore I support the rights of men and women equally. It is just amusing to see how quickly this argument is made about feminists on Reddit though in these kinds of threads. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the obligatory negative social justice remark in the comments. 

If I were a woman I'd probably be offended by this game more than I'd take pride under it.. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen them do it to women for just expressing her opinion or making a free game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gay marriage is a current problem that deserves to be acknowledged. whether female characters are portrayed inaccurately in WW1 games or not isn't one of those problems that needs to be discussed and revised. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not only men, many women aswell.

Hell, many women even consider hyper-sexualized female characters to be "empowering". But no, SJW's are the end-all be-all opinion of the human race.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a minor. And it isn't that she believes I'm a pervert, she just doesn't care for any explicit content in the family space (then again, it was her who told me to move the computer here.... maybe she isn't too logical either).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except that is what the comment is saying, he said that she would see herself if her head was 2m behind her, implying that the view she has is that of the characters eyes. So he was certainly not wrong and you pretty much did elaborate on what he was saying and...well this is pointless I don't know why I'm rambling, as you were. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know exactly when the video is from, and I don't care enough to go look it up, but she says "As a mom and a Senator". She hasn't been a senator for over a decade, so I am pretty sure this is way before the email scandal, either of her presidential runs, or anything else going on right now.
 

Knowing Hillary, I'm sure her position on this will have changed the second popular opinion on the subject did =P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mixed up you and muffinmuncher. But you were saying I replied to someone who wasn't talking about her opinion on the game...I see no reason why I shouldn't assume muffinmuncher wasn't commenting on what unassassinable said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean the political pundit that admited in the past that she doesn't like videos games, who then lied and claimed that she was a gamer since she was a little girl?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
angry much? no one wants to be with someone who is judgemental. that's obviously a rhetorical question with an ulterior motive. regardless of your and your wife's opinion the general public's perception, both men and women alike, is vast video game's collections are things better left to children - not adults. congratulations on finding a woman who doesn't judge you based on the wider culture's opinion on games. now stop being fussy and play mega man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Feminist != female; MRA != male

Source: I'm a male feminist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, she makes YouTube videos where she utterly misrepresents the content of video games, makes unfounded accusations and attacks anyone who dares to point out the fact that a huge portion of what she says is flat out made up. This makes a lot of gamers very, very angry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everything is sooo acurrate, even the fact that she's blonde.  Good for you!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet you try to defend adverts that portray women as objects because 'The ads are trying to promote playing video games, not healthy attitudes.'


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hillary doesn't understand people. She represents evil and stupidity. 

Unless she's attempting Trumps marketing scheme of "say anything to get people's attention." If so, then at least she's evolving.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow. There is something very wrong with you. Not only have you completely lost civility over a game, but your attempted insults make no sense: there is nothing ironic about his/her comment and user name, and what is lucky or unlucky about your taste in games? You truly are a special little snowflake aren't you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Listen. Before you downvote me, let me just say.

She has a bit of a point. Notice I said a bit. Children should not be playing the games that she is talking about, HOWEVER, not all games are like this, and they don't cause violence in people. All I'm saying is that children shouldn't be playing them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And there's nothing wrong with that. You do you man. Or girl I suppose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or objectifying women as sexual objects...

Despite the refusal of acknowledgment by the majority of gamers...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh yeah, he would have crumbled like Trump was supposed to crumble, right? Look at how far Bernie got with grassroots funding and wildly inexperienced staffers. Look at how passionate people on the_donald are. Now tell me that Hillary was the candidate to oppose that movement. At least there was a spark with Bernie. Hillary wouldn't even talk to media, how the fuck was she supposed to inspire a movement to counter his? Your speculation is worth no more than mine at this point so let me be sad if you don't mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
flipside: girl gets singled out and insulted for being a girl... guy gets insulted for sucking (or maybe for being a "hacker")

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh. I hate some of the far-out Tumblr culture too, but I don't feel like the game was a political statement and it was actually pretty well done. Flawed characters such as Chloe were not shown to be perfect and I get the feeling that you were supposed to get annoyed with her especially around the second/third episode.. 

And the soundtrack was enjoyable.

Just let people have nice things, okay?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're actually curious, there's [this]( massive list of non-binary gender identities. 

If you think that's a load of bs, then the only other thing is the fact that it's biologically possible to be born with both male and female reproductove organs, so there's that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
lol, why do you assume she's pretending? Video games are mainstream now. You aren't special. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; there aren't many women in gaming

citation needed, IGDA disagrees with you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have a misconception, one that a lot of people in your position as well as OP have.

Just because the majority of men don't care that male characters are portrayed a certain way doesn't mean that women or sympathetic men can't be offended by how women are portrayed. Different things bother different people.

The fact is, women have in the past always been portrayed poorly in all sorts of media. The whole damsel in distress trope is front lined in the very first main stream video game.

You say a minority care? I say your group of sjw gamers are actually the minority. Most people don't care either way whether devs changed minuscule details of a game to be more inclusive to all people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That Anita feminist chick does in one of her idiotic videos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's apologized for that many times. I'm not defending the statement, but she's sorry, or at least pretending to be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;By seeing what people buy.

&gt;Actions speak louder than words.

Do you really not think that the portrayal of women in video games has changed? At one point they were basically just objects to be rescued. It has changed and as you've said, it wouldn't have changed if there wasn't support for it financially. 

&gt;It's not. There's a clear *moral* aspect to the whole "women are being portrayed badly in games" objections, going so far as to claim that it causes actual harm, a la "this is misogyny and contributes to oppression, body image issues, etc". This isn't "Oh, I would like this, thanks." This is "What you're doing is morally wrong and you have to change it." 

Did *I* ever say that? You're mad at some arguments made by some one else and that's some how my fault? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dragonball Z ended in 1996. A more recent show in the same vein was Naruto, whose blatant fangirl lust bait character was Uchiha Sasuke. Not exactly a muscleman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of her videos are just basically Feminism 101, and the fact that people respond with such disdain to that here is a little embarrassing. 

Like, if you want your media to be treated as an 'art form' you should at least be willing to have it analysed through a variety of different lenses. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
fuck...i really don't want to vote trump but this idiocy cannot be allowed in the presidency. I hope she rebuts this and announces she has changed her opinion on this matter in the last 8 years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nah, she often says it is fine to like something while still criticizing sexist elements. But people act like she is trying to ban games. She gets a ton of death threats.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That wasn't exactly what she said, and warping her words to match what you want to imply is kinda as bad as what she said. I agree that is what the sentiment of what she said was, but saying blankly that's what she said isn't correct.

I can understand her logic, don't agree with it, but understand it. The logic is teach a developing mind one thing all their life and that's what they'll know. So her logic, which has no evidence to back it, is that a developing mind learning to kill will only cause that child to kill. But I think the thing that gets taught to those minds is actually "Man I like video games" and not "Man I like killing people".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His statement is still there. Nothing has been silenced. I have simply given my opinion on his/her opinion. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wrong for the truth?

No

The only folk who care about things like this a fat females.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I will admit she does change towards the end, but I feel that that's only because she sees just how massively destructive her actions have been.

I could go very spoiler-ey and just list off the things she does that show how bad she was, but Lets agree to disagree and save the eyes of anyone innocent reading this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a weired reaction I'm getting here for this.

People think I'm white knighting to get her to like me.

People think I can't comment on my account of my username (not you).

People just think I'm wrong.

Some people now agree with me.

My emotions are all over
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Criticism is not hating without saying anything more than death threats.  
You could disagree her point, but discussing is the way to criticism not hating.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's wrong with not having a character being completely sexualized in a way that takes away from who she is as a character?

Nothing is wrong with it. Not having everything catered to your tastes is okay.

____________________ TOPIC 10 ______________________________

She's cosplaying a guy that's full of muscle. Of course people are going to complain when they see something like this. It has nothing to do with her personal beauty or whatever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure why you're convinced it's desperation, but then again you were willing to instantly call people who find non real girls attractive degenerates.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would be gross watching Mads romance women a fraction of his age
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ahh thought there was someone hiding behind her. Awesome present :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She would be great to have sex with, she wouldn't talk afterwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dont know, half naked women everywhere, things seems fine here. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is a crime that this doesn't have more upvotes. Just because he isn't a sexy half naked girl doesn't mean he shouldn't get respect....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she does it, it's okay. When I do it, it's "sexual assualt"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Well of course it's sexual. I'm just saying that Capcom didn't go "cyaor let's have her sexy arse out for no reason".

nobody said that!!1!!11
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; When is okay to sexualize women being sexy

Always.

&gt; when am I a jerk for noticing?

never
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dude it's okay, most of us don't have girlfriends either.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep in mind though that the line before this is a little girl asking "what's libido?" so I mean it's kind of both - the kid is definitely talking about sex 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because attractive half naked women make literally every single thing better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah it was obviously just a reason for her to be almost naked all the time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she realized it or not, it certainly didn't need to be rubbed in. Dude is no better than Dylan
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're a dude, he's a dude, she's a dude, WE'RE ALL DUDES 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Nothing like giving a dude a handy before molesting his girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;but I do think some iconic quality has gone missing in her design.

 You miss the boobs. It's okay. We understand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everyone is interested in (attractive) female booty. Men and women, children and adults.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  the women look like eye candy.

Like women want to look? What kind of percentage of the women want to look like Brienne of Tarth? Not the feminine majority, I'll tell you that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Designed by a woman, mind you. In the way Conan was designed by a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A female dude is a just a dude, I think. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can appreciate that they're nice, but I don't feel a sexual attraction toward her.  :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a difference between dudes drawing dudes for hetro dudes to look at, and dudes drawing women for hetro dudes to look at. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They designed her to be attractive so you shouldn't feel too bad :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You aren't supposed to feel helpless, because she is not helpless
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should be happy. Does she know how rare snorlaxes are?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is it that androgynous male characters are always more attractive than female characters?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she doesn't crit. she's definitely an off healer and not primary.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But is a copyrighted work someone's property? Is someone entitled to the economic value of his or her creative efforts? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No he didn't she complained that it was sexual and didn't got her personality 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Despite what people say, guys *really* can't take being beaten by a girl in video games. Playing mercy or healer is just much less confrontational, making it easier to enjoy the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the real heroes here are the game designers who create these female characters that are almost naked.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, if it makes her happy. He only wants her to be happy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand the turf is verdant, and the females rather attractive 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact that she gets mad about it makes it even better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Along with the fact that she's not attracted to you sexually
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Men have an obsession with sexual things and women have an obsession with looking attractive.

Both are base and different sides of the same coin.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
we need more. please do other characters. i miss the girl who drew squids
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, that Forsaken ad is just a naked lady. Not even trying to cover it up.

(which is fine by me)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is me asking why men aren't sexualized in the same way as women somehow shaming you? I don't think you know what the buzzwords you're clumsily repeating actually mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like the designer made her purple, and then realized they had to justify it somehow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because she's a fictional character, that's why. Why should devs be beholden to how certain people see a character, and not others? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is she mad about your gaming too much, or is that just a nerdy pun?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I absolutely love seeing all these naked women characters in western games!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe her version is a sexy variant? What's wrong with the character being sexy?

There are PLENTY of people that try to shame any woman using a sex toy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Additionally, believe it or not, girls play video games and like sex! It's almost like we're just people with different bits! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what you're saying is it's ok for female characters in games to be sexy, as long as the devs don't show us?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least get a hot half naked girl on there for the ad...

____________________ TOPIC 11 ______________________________

Missed a car driving over her at the end.
Disappointing...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was just talking to her, and it was her car, she was at the airport the other evening. She does appreciate that you like her car, and said that she has a few more things planned for the car, but needs to save up some money for those plans.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the fact that the car really did kill her makes it way funnier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't you know that a male and a female can't be talking with each other unless they are dating? /s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ask him if he wants a mmf threesome. No matter how rich he is he can't spit roast a woman all by himself. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Recently split up with a girl after 7 years, this has come at a perfect time for me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But if women would blow up my inbox with compliments and offerings of friendship that would be pretty dope.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least I'll be able to hack myself a girlfriend-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
anything really, she has a chromebook so she cant really download anything
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her that! She's been cryin about me wasting it for like an hour!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dammit where was that girl when I was interning at my first computer repair job.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's my one and only. So she got the pc I built in 2009 when I built a new one a year or so ago.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But you don't mind if Sally has it her way at the expense of Johnny?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Already have a good pc just get bored of it sometimes and want a change and so me and my girlfriend have something to play online and coop together 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I figured she wouldn't really be in the lineup like this. So do you think one of those figures is Javier?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably didn't help that she was a really messy person initially which may have contributed to an overall scruffiness.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm very aware, but I know myself too well and I'd end up putting my shit in her PC and getting myself all new stuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am playing it right now.

What is "Help roach..." ?

Roach isn't moving, how can I help her ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just don't get why siding with the Minutemen was such a big deal to her.

I literally run that faction. They'll do whatever I tell them anyway. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to show her how long I can stay under with my Argonian lungs. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It also helps the slabs of cake stay together. My wife loves her yt channel
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's sad and simple. These men are sexually frustrated and through a level of anonymity they feel entitled to release that frustration on every woman they run across online. I'm sorry you have to deal with their shit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, you can have my wife. I recently stopped needing her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved her complete fire immunity. I stopped playing her when they removed that, and started playing Wendy. I switched back now that we can make lighters for our friends!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fact that you let you daughter spend a year of her life doing something that can be achieved in a couple of minutes on PC makes me pity her. She doesn't know any better. YOU SHOULD. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he had done this in the first place she wouldn't have absolutely wasted one of her formative years. This post is actually sickening to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's a gamer on youtube, and another big youtubers girlfriend
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even though I keep telling her that, she still struggles with confidence. So seeing that feedback helps I hope. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; and of course she has to be some Mary-Sue who can do everything better than the other pieces...

that's exacly what Rey in tfa was, she was perfect at everything.
She even managed to make han solo look like an idiot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend who doesn't play many games somehow found this and showed it to me a couple of months ago, been following it since. Looks good! :) Hoping I can get a PC at some point so I can play it 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She loved [anything with a screen on it]( If I had to clean her home or something I'd put her in front of a tv or my laptop to watch videos of bugs, although she seemed to like non-bug videos too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dated a girl like this. It was so sad. Got annoying after two weeks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what tinker? Most webshops offers assembly for computers for like 5bucks(atleast where i live) ,and i think theres a computer shop near u that would help upgrade your computer like every 2-3 years , if anybody think thats too much hassle then he/she deserve it.And theres a bunch of OK pre-builts out there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whatever it is, it is awesome that she makes games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's the same day I watched my friend throw her remote at and through her big screen TV because Timberlake lost some award or something on the MTV awards we were all watching lmao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She did for as long as she was programed to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We men have let women run rough shod right over us for too long.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Letting her waste a whole year's of work because she doesn't know how video games and computers work is not good advice at all. All that's going to happen is that she'll be very upset that all her work was ruined because of something she had no way of knowing.

Letting her ruin a year of work because some dumbfuck idea that she has to "learn that not everything goes your way" is not a good idea. You don't teach that stuff by watching her cry as her one year project is flushed down the toilet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meh, crazy can fuck. Plus, you know she'll help you rob a bank. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend doesn't realize her telling me she's going to delete the game from my phone are empty threats.  :)  I'll let her think she has the power.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would do terrible things to her (as long as its consensual)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Really? I never used her. I recently played for the first time and Boone with ED-E was my set up. Why is she so beloved?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good for you. You know what makes you happy and it's a perfect representation of *you*. It's awesome she was able to throw in some perfect flair that you'll be able to proudly display. I couldn't think of a better fit! Congrats! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is she into? I might be able to offer better suggestions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to think that these 3 dudes helped out the grandmother and now they just get brunch every Thursday and help her out with laundry or something
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Long explanation:

Short explanation:
Sign in your profile on your wife's Xbox, set it through the settings as YOUR home Xbox

Do the same with her profile on your Xbox and set HER home Xbox as your Xbox

Now you can both buy one of whatever game (and even one live gold account) to share
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't understand why she'd lean on a running car.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How long did it take her (hours)?  This was an incredible challenge.  Awesome work!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My SO is fine with my 8+ hours a day at my pc,

I do have my pc in the same room as the TV so TBF I'm spending time with her all day. ;)

Or if you're female soak a tampon in alcohol and go to town

Little does she know he's been having an affair and has a mistress and an entire secret family in Stardew Valley. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because if you fail the woman you can get sued for discrimination, which is expensive win or lose.

We are all living in a Pokemon world

And I am a Pokemon girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you look at the previous ones she did a couple with a few small pokemon in a large terrarium but they were kind of shit. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's women all over the planet. Have you tried looking for them instead? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She hired a guy to follow her with a large mirror.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I respect that.

I showed the game to my wife and she thought it was the dumbest thing she'd ever seen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You must live alone. If my significant other wanted to keep that she'd be single.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually got in an accident today, right next to a fire truck luckily. The girl was playing Pokemon go. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
See this is why I actively go after women who are just as nerdy as I am. You could always try Pokemon though. Everyone loves Pokemon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some of them aren't even hidden. One of the pokedex entries for a pokemon that only evolves if it is female mentions how it will form a "reverse harem" since the females of the species are the dominant force.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No because then she'll think you aren't a man as stipulated in the appendix to rule #0102
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she bring it down to the basement for you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know this will eventually lead to her moving out and joining a nudist colony
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gears of War 4 has females getting destroyes and dismembered. Last Of Us is one of the best games of this generation and it has gore and dismemberment. I doubt it's what you're implying. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeeeaah... that happens to everyone. Everyone tries to roast everyone in communities like CS:GO, and they try to find ways to shit on you, and since you're a female, which is a minority in the gaming community, they'll use that a lot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but she ended up doing the thing

for the rest of their lives :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what I'm sayin'!  Although, it might come off a bit passive-aggressive... or it could be the army of troops outside her border.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Go watch one of her videos and report back.
Genuinely interested in what you think of her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have also discovered a planet already discovered by someone else.  The weird part is that that person did not discover the system, or any other planets within it.  How could he/she discover that one planet but not the system?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even creepier that he's been living in her basement without her knowledge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty great how we're all about privacy until we get a chance to make women to show us more than they were willing to in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The bad ending involves your psycho male roommate. Also some of the girls have bad endings like Rin. I do recomend doing the rest of the routes though because Rin is bae. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's time you got down on one knee and said to that woman:  
 *circle circle square x square triangle x circle*

200,000 people doesn't really count as a win, that number shouldn't determine the presidency.
 
Trump won across every state she needed to win. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The look jen had on her face when she orders her drinks and turns around and sees that it's Moss bar tending is so great. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My entire life revolved around videogames. So i found friends whos lives also revolved around videogames. Then we discovered alcohol. Then we discovered girls. So on and so forth and now i have a family of my own. Just leave your house and talk to people. Its easy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Twitch will ban your channel for nudity. I don't know if he streams for a living or not, but if he does then she more a less just almost got him fired. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet she is going to lose Tuesday because her top adviser is a literal satanist who drinks sperm :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because men and women are different biologically, men are better in several area's, where women are better in different area's.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never been in a group that didn't have at least one girl. But then I've really only had 2 groups for the last 5 years. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That armour is in now way going to protect her, the assassins union needs to sort this out. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


I looked it up and she did win the popular vote. Or is currently winning at least.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Set her up a twitch! Then put donations into a college fund!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For me, she keeps getting out of it and wandering around, and not even at night time either, don't even have a bar at Sanctuary. I have Preston in a pillory and he never gets out of it. So I've decided that I will instead unleash a bunch of Deathclaws on Sanctuary.

Proceeds to viciously run over an old woman as everyone continues to cheer  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or is she just another cam girl turned female gamer streamer who streams pre recorded vids
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Twitch chat was blasting her worse than nagasaki and hiroshima.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Friend of mine worked at Niantech at the time and mentioned it was more like poor organization, unclear leadership, and a poor work environment that caused her to leave during Ingress. Apparently there was some massive restructuring prior to the Pokemon Go project.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First be a good looking out woman and then go live some place fancy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, with a girlfriend/wife, kids and stuff, yeah they tend to not respect the "I'm sleeping, stay the fuck out" unwritten rule.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her username on Twitch is SayviTV, she's actually streaming right now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She streams regularly on Twitch, her username is SayviTV :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bull... They were going to off her to see if there was a chance that it might do some good... they didn't have the resources to make it happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He... erm... she is Transgender, so respect her chosen identity!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I live in Texas too, my girlfriend and I just decided to do other shit during the daytime, and when it gets darker go out and catch some pokemon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After 200 or more (I've stopped counting) attempts of her never missing, I've concluded that is not how it works.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is how I play games with my girlfriend, it's the only way to simultaneously let her feel involved and stop me from feeling frustrated. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Must be an All female team. Only females get death threats online /s

If you saw their girlfriends, you would not feel bad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure this was posted before, but instead of friend it was girlfriend. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's a link to a [Forbes article]( about it and there is links within the article to other articles about it. Didn't even know this was a thing until I saw this reddit post. Why is this even a thing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some guy above mentioned the girls are some Kardashian afterbirth, but still don't know about the weeb hood ornaments.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Link, you don't have to be an emo cutter.  The princess will definitely sleep with you if you rescue her again.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Twilight princess doesn't feel like a Zelda to me. And I hate that they're bringing in a girl version of Link
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everyone knows that girls play games too. If you look at her post history, it's pretty obvious she's not trying to show off the game. She's trying to show off her tits.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's actually his girlfriend who does all the make up. They both have Facebook pages so I'd suggest asking on her page. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd really like to know how she made all that stuff, does she have a how-to site?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
there's one that's not as... anticlimactic, and the one the poster above referred to. should be in here:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
go post it to /r/ladyboners and it will do fine. but there are way more men on reddit than women so obviously its not going to be one of the highest posts on the entire site
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it's definitely karma-whoring if she chose to make a separate post instead of putting it in her original post
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you have to ask your wife for permission to post her ass on reddit?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet 20+ people post pictures of what gaming related trinket their girlfriend made for them every few minutes, and none of them get crucified to this extent. I didn't realize there was some huge requirement for posts in this sub. Should I have asked permission before posting anything?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


EDIT:  [Link of the above image from her DA page](  Don't steal people's work without crediting, guys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I sent this site earlier to my girlfriend actually for an obviously different reference and it looks like they've even updated downloadmoreram.com from how it was a while back. That's dedication.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a bit of this and that. It's never been confirmed either way. he/she has been referred to as he or she in various contexts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Zelda is a girl as in princess Zelda the hero is link
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, her friends on various gaming blogs shoveled her into relevancy even though nobody really cared. I'm sure she got like... 2 threats, and next thing you know Polygon and Kotaku are going "See how literally every single gamer is trying to kill women?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she has a package in that picture
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but the #1 is so good he/she wouldn't go down like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just found that post, from 4 years ago. I feel bad for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What? No pictures of her vault?

Edit: Since this is the top comment as of this edit, I'm adding her Instagram: Thanks /u/PineappleInTheMist 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In reference to the title only, though she is rather reptilian
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am genuinely curious as to why he/she said "really?" to that comment.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But you did take her picture though otherwise it wouldn't be posted here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah.. I facebook stalked too. Can confirm what this guy said. This actually is a real girlfriend on Reddit for once.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can now confirm that where ever Marion Cotillard goes she is followed by the ominous BWAAARP.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is a reincarnation of himself, why would he be reincarnated as a woman?

Link is a dude.  So at best that's Zelda dressed as Link.  The Caption asks *What if Zelda was a girl?* but Zelda already is a girl, Zelda is the princess.  So they Confused Link with Zelda, drew Link as a girl, then posed the question *what if Zelda was a girl?* when it looks like they meant *What if Link was a girl?*

Reddit is like women. The more I think I understand it, it confuses me even more.

[Here's the picture for Kitana](

And [here is Heisenberg]( mentioned by /u/Jonopono123, next to Supergirl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP has a girlfriend guys!!! All hail OP! All hail OP!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If looking at a picture of a girl on the internet is a waste of time then surely commenting about looking at a picture of a girl on the internet is even worse.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His original comment was "girlfriend material"
My comment was directed to Phillije not Wolfedale1
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does Holly Wolf have her own Sub Reddit? I have tried searching and cannot find one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she was any good, she'd have her own site to post pictures instead of using Imgur.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believed this until I saw there was a girl there. Clearly the signs were added before or after and this was really a GoT fanclub meeting. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I saw this picture and title I was thinking "girlfriend/wife, right?" I guess I was right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hello my lady, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You said it and I haven't yet gotten into the darkzone, so I have time to [link you to the relevant chain!](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I showed her that I posted her drawing on reddit. 
She sent me a screenshot of your comment and said "yes please" as the caption. Thank you, distant wingman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You do realize the new Zelda game has link as a female?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How is the title misleading? I watched the whole thing and that's exactly what she's saying
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, she's very obese.  My point was that I don't think that's what OP was meaning in the title.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But people on reddit are not supposed to have girlfriends or am I the only one 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No Link is the continuously reincarnated embodiment of the 1st reincarnation of Hylia's friend who was a male and named Link. Just like Zelda is the continuously reincarnated embodiment of Hylia the female goddess. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How did OP post this and not the girl who got gifted?

You stole her Santa karma OP, you dirty Grinch karma whore!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know if she does, but the one op has looks good
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I took the screenshot when she showed me her phone and then posted it here.

____________________ TOPIC 14 ______________________________

It's so real I want to hit her with a rocket propelled hammer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think you've realized what you've done, look forward to masturbation! she'll be running into her bedtime hours playing skyrim! I made the same error, she was once counting her climax level now she is just trying to get her smithing skill to 100!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no way. She can die from like two shots. If you can't hit her then aim harder.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would be cool if her beam locked onto multiple targets at one time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or she proved to herself that she's able to do anything. That takes a lot of determination to finish that. Even though it's useless.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;What is with that woman not using the run button? **I get not rushing into things but jeez.**

I see what you did. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like she's stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She died for me. The stupid thing hit her and she hit a fucking rock and died &gt;_&gt;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ebrietas had her ridiculous charge attacks and long range, Oceiros has a ridiculous charge attack and long range.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahahahaha, great editing man.  I feel your pain, too - Dancer was by far the hardest boss for me on my first playthrough.  I had to summon two other players in order to beat her.

Oddly enough, I wound up beating her solo on my first attempt in NG+, and again on NG++.  I don't know whether it was just being somewhat higher level, if my reflexes just improved, or if I finally managed to get her timing and moveset down pat, but whatever it was, I was grateful.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When she is healing you, it shows you her health bar and the direction she is healing you from.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah otherwise you have to travel through goatse gravemind level to get her back
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love Symmetra but her play style kind of forces her to be a bit of a scaredy cat. Some really good players know how to aim her charged shots and run to the battleground. I had a few matches where I  recklessly ran around notching 15 kills that way. 7 from my charged shots and 8 from turrets.

The funniest thing to do is to either set up 6 ambush turrets in a choke point or enemy escort path or slap 3 turrets on an escort vehicle and watch it rack up kills especially if Reinhardt shields the turrets on it.

Escort mode in this game gets wacky with all the turret antics you can do. I also saved a hopeless match by having 3 Bastion turrets on an enemy vehicle while I  shielded them as Reinhardt. A near hopeless match turned into a train of death against the enemies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she stood up to every challenge, no matter however demanding.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At one point she could pass through time itself IIRC. I think I'll let this one slide.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She could easily have used her hands/arms stretched out ahead of her to somewhat take the blow, Lara just wanted to end it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a move she will actually perform to recover health during her fight.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While Jean is really good in this game, Magma is better.

Burning Rage (add fire damage to attacks) + Fiery Form (gives her a shield and more energy damage to attacks) + Ultra Power Enhancer (adds more than 100 damage to each mutant attack) = Not only doing insane damage with each attack, but Fiery Form means you are super tanky as well.  You can walk around and your burning armor does 100's of damage just by standing there.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mercy needs a skill that pulls allies to her. Maybe then someone will stay on the objective.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless she gets hit by a giant and fly's up into the atmosphere.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She doesnt even actively fight you iirc. Just her many many followers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's not nearly angular enough to pull it off. There's not a single point on her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if her turrets healed as well as damage? Like 2 beams.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's also why I liked Ellie in the Last of Us. Plus, she was helpful when shit hit the fan, especially in harder difficulties.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and she drops her soda right before getting hit.  Now that's some detailed shit.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He can't beat it, he/she is just to good. (or cause Spartan's never die)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a bad way of balancing her.

Her damage drops off very quickly if you can get out of range of her. Which is really easy to do, since she slows down while shooting her shotguncannons.

Her health isn't very hard to take down; her armor is good, but she's still easy to kill.

Further, she's actually easier/better sometimes to play outside of her suit since, aside from the squishiness, she can compete at long ranges. 

She's good at flanking; not at tanking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've had that happen.

After the second hit she's dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's really not too tough learning wise. It's just remembering each character's abilities and what buttons do what moves that can be a little tricky at first. But they've got the training mode and practice range to help. If you're good with CoD, I'd recommend Soldier 76, he plays kind of like that, but there's no aiming. He's also got missiles, can heal himself, and his ultimate is basically an aim bot. If you're into quick scoping, maybe Widowmaker since her gun is an assault rifle/sniper all in one. She has a grappling hook to get around with and venom mines she can set up anywhere. Her ultimate is like a map hack or whatever where you and your team can see enemies locations through walls. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bloodborne and The Last of Us are two of the best games ever made.

Also, get LittleBigPlanet to play with her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're trained to throw them troops into the cover and dive on top of them. The only voluntary part of that after the bad toss was the two steps she took towards the bags.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Run. Do a lot of running and when you're done running do some more running.

Then have him/her go out for another run.

Learn how to do a PLF.

and be good at pushups.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know about an arrow, but I would definitely shoot something into her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Wow**... I really want to see that entire 1v1 as a single sequence with no cuts just to see how fucking ridiculous that basketball game was.

I tried counting the cuts, and by the time she jumped off the wall they had already gone so far off the rails I lost track by 25
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus she can rez, or if its Reinhart just give him a damage buff and let him kill everyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My idea for makin Sym an actual support: Change her give shield ability to give a buff that when ever an ally is close to a turret or teleporter they gain a shield that lasts until destroyed or player moves too far from turret/tp. 

The buff has a cooldown that starts when shield is destroyed and player cannot gain a shield while this cooldown is up.

Also if a turret gives ... lets say 2 players(Stack system. has 2 stacks before cd) a shield it also goes into cooldown(Why? read next line )

Turrets have also a heat up system like zarya that once they deal a certain ammount of damage they can use one of their stacks (Unless under cd in which case nothing happens)  to shield themselves or another turret!

Not sure if there is a forum i can post this at...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How else does she travel around when you keep using quick travel?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is Sabrina the last real threat to me out of the trainers (I just beat her, hardest battle since Misty)?  I should have a type advantage over the other two.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she fights Ganondorf in a cutscene in the Forsaken Fortress before Ganondorf realizes who she is.

[She doesn't get a lot of hits in, but this does count as attacking someone and thus entering combat](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sombra isn't bad,  she just has very limited use scenarios. 

I've gotten quite adept at getting myself out of situations with the teleporter (back up as someone is shooting you, throw over their head, teleport, run like hell)

Her gun isn't the strongest, but if you manager to get behind someone, hack them, then drop a full clip in their backs, you will get all but the tankiest characters down. 

The EMP ult has small uses but team it up with someone else,  like D.Va, and you'll kill everyone. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you point a gun at her while she's begging you not to kill her she'll give you about $50 to spare her.  Then she runs away.  Provided you didn't issue her a new nostril in the meantime.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'll find them sparingly throughout the game world. You also get them if you help beat a boss if you lay down your summon sign. Buy the item called the white soapstone from the red robed lady in the main hub to be able to join other people's games. It's also really helpful to learn the layout of a level or boss without really losing anything
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Battle Tanx. You're not really fighting to survive, but fighting to get your girl back after most of the females have died.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but you'll know the angle you need to shoot from so that the arrow goes over the fence kills that woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I beat her in the attempt immediately after the post. She didn't hit me once that time, which was strange. She seemed slower on the final attempt  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
maybe if she was able to give out more than a measly 25 point shield only once per life she can be useful. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So what, you want her to be literally in space fighting an aggressive parasite?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shiek is definitely the easiest to recover with in Sm4sh, her up-b is really hard to punish and it covers a really good distance 

Fox you can gimp pretty easily 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks! But Leia was only throwing melee so I think she wasn't trying. If she shot my back or after the saber throw I think I woulda died
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After the shield matrix is established, make her ability button raise the shields for 4 seconds up to 50-75, and then have a 15-20 sec cooldown?

And if anyone dies, you have to reestablish the shield matrix to use the ability again

I thought it was a teenage boy, not a girl.

Similar things were happening in Europe at the time though, people would marry a young girl and have sex as soon as she "bled"

No, he's married to a Pence.

Ah. I thought you were saying these were high school girls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unlikely.  He's been happily married for many years.
He also had way more girlfriends in college than I ever did :\

In school I was taught to just use they instead of he or she if it was unknown.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't say I wasn't grateful. I'm very grateful. The point is I would rather have a physical copy cause my internet isn't very good to download, and have lost digital downloads before. 

And by credit her account, I mean credit to her Gamestop account.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's what happens when you don't return her calls... #bitchgocrazy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My aunt gave me her Sierra Games collection. Never lettin that shit go.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How did it come about? And why is she so willing to give you this awesome collection.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
GameStop didNINTENDO buy that from her so you probably got a good deal. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she smokes weed out of an apple.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pre Order like a dummy.

Her Birthday is in late July and so I set up her Steam account for her and Ordered this the same day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should get some google play &amp; apple store cards while she's at it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but...why didn't she just pull those cards out of the box prior to the party if she was the one who brought them?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He just want's it delivered to my house so his wife doesn't find it.

And ordered on my credit card so she wouldn't see the invoice on the credit card bill.

And wanted me to check it out to make sure it works right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she and I bought weed from the same guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But did he find a her to open the box? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Score! I pulled that same shit and aunt let me borrow her copy of mrs doubtfire
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Should have used your Master Ball on her, it's quicker.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she knows your name but still calls you Chief, she knows her place :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but, didn't she already do that halfway through the first one?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I pressed her A and immoderately got a restraining order
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No she doesn't. You have to put it down in order for her to cuddle it which means you already stopped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My aunt was on the final boss of Donkey Kong 64. One day I went to her house, and while playing it I found the save files and deleted one and it deleted it by throwing one of the orange grenades at it and it would blow up the file. I deleted all the save files so I could see the animation. Such a jerk move...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, you see, when a male customer and a female customer like each other enough and both want to pre-order a child...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good tip. I'll try it. Also, apparently there's a "last save" feature that she told me this morning.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I haven't played much of halo 5, you guys are talking about Cortana right? She died in Halo 4 which was a 343 game and then 343 brought her back to life in halo 5. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
L.A. Noire got my wife interested for a few minutes...that was the closest I got. Since then I've just made female characters that look like her and name them her nickname backwards, Isis. Of course, in the current US climate, that's gotten me some hate but it's now automatic for me. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The AT &amp; T girl should play her, names are similar
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She can bring things with her, though. There's a section in the game where she steals a set of keys then goes back in time to before she took them but still has them in her inventory. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How so? My girlfriend just bought me the game and I've played but I haven't messed with mods yet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend always finds amusing that I have a "DOCUMENTS" folder in Documents, but the Documents folder is literally unusable with all the different config files/folders! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They did the same thing to me. I want to buy Pokemon Y for my girlfriend and it said new on the Shelf and when she was checking me out she opened the drawer and pulled out the cartridge and put it in the box from the Shelf. When I asked her why I wasn't getting a sealed box she said it was because it was the last copy they had and they had to have a box on the Shelf. It's total bullshit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you ask your Santa where she/he got it so I can buy a set? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good point... maybe she couldn't reach with the other 2 in the way?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right, theres a seam only where her vagina would be but her vagina is invisible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like the one where at some point she's like "gimme my ice cream!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Best part is you can then switch to the wife and change what she looks like, then return to your own character and have a custom wife.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just checked my gf's because she never deletes save files and she has already reached 1G
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Have they managed to make the girls not look like plastic yet?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why not tell her a steam card so you can buy the game you want
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Corrin's already out though, isn't he/she? Saw him/her in the eshop yesterday.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, most of the time, or Sandra from the liquor store she will do anything 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Literally the first thing I thought when I saw the big covenant-looking ship was 

"This is Halo: Reach."

And then I saw the woman running her fingers over the commemorative plaque.

"This is a mixture of Halo: Reach and Halo 3."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wonderful, but if anything she went from the Mustang to the donkey; I think I would take any MG over a Chrysler LeBaron 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend and I picked up Trine a little while back on steam and we have had a great time with it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yesterday a girl asked for my digits so I told her; 1:0:29278475. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My wife was admitted with a case of acute gastritis, and while she was doped up I tried to amuse myself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you marry her, then her credit card debt becomes your credit card debt, and then you've just bought yourself a present.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Commies are pro women. This guy is clearly a trumpet

____________________ TOPIC 17 ______________________________

&gt; suits her character more.

Four other characters use this pose. So are they all being changed also because they don't fit the "personality" of the video game character?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she's not fit enough to be cammy. Look at them legs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
remember apparently her having an ass "didn't fit her personality"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder how many markers are used to motion capture her butt...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They replaced the pose with one that shows her ass even more
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shit maybe I just never really thought about it that way since ass is usually emphasized on women more. Now I feel I need to tone my ass more since my squats are prob not heavy enough
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it was more over the pose than her actual butt.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A think the argument (and the reason Blizzard gave) was that it isn't part of Tracer's personality. She's a Tom-Boy. Not a sexual character at all. This pose felt out of place for her. The same pose exists on other characters including Hanzo and Widowmaker, but it fits them. The butt doesn't angle up for them making it look bad ass on Hanzo and still very very sexual on Widowmaker (but it fits her). Tracer just felt out of place in this pose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel bad for the waist cincher she's clearly wearing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
its not, look at her nose.
not the same face at all.
similar, but definitely not the same person
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
/r/whataboutSRS

They missed the part where the person was completely fine with the same pose being on Widowmaker, because she's a character defined by her sexiness. Tracer is not.

The problem was never the ass. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the kitten on her shoulder, the eyes make it cuter :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah because that's the only difference between her pose and Hanzo's /s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it's a " look over the shoulder " pose that many characters have. 

what about it doesn't fit her character ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


honestly the pose almost does more for her chest than her butt
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
woah man to much skin is showing near her eyes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Spare me the bullshit. There's a big difference between facing the camera and not facing the camera. If the pose was exactly the same, but adjusted to point towards the camera, that'd be fine. But it isn't, because it's not "just standing", she's showing off her ass.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Something seems a little off... Outfit looks alright, but her face doesn't match at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She look like she has leg and arm cramps. Why is she standing like that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me too to be honest. I thought it was Tracer bending downwards, with her butt facing the camera.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No. It was the generic 'girl showing off her ass' pose that's been used a million times before. If anything, that's a good reason in itself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Well, someone wanted to complain about Tracer having a ~~sexual~~ pose that showed her ass 

Don't dignify their viewpoint by saying the pose was sexual.  It wasn't.  It was an over the shoulder pose and nothing more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
1) All those things you mentioned about Tracer's pose being designed to showcase her butt, is pretty much how she stands [all the time]( And since you seem to know a lot about anatomy, I'm sure you already know that this is all textbook 101 stylizing for drawing females in comics.

So is the problem her pose, or the angle at which we're viewing her?

2) Look at [this]( picture of her in the exact same pose, but in a different outfit. Do you still feel that the predominant focus point is her butt? 

So is the problem her pose, or the outfit she's wearing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If that was the case they would've changed Widowmaker

Tracer was doing a pin up pose, something that's not exactly in her character, it's fairly clear why they'd change it 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not that the new pose resolved any of this guys concerns. Tracer is still a woman and has an ass. Now she just lifts one leg in addition.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No one is saying her leg to body ratio is unattainable the problem people seem to have is her hips to waist ratio her booty to waist ratio etc which is clearly something people can achieve with hard work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the crap are you taking about?

The pose says nothing contrary to her character AT ALL.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or by the fact that she made herself a widow
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's something incredibly arousing about her legs being splayed like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It wasn't even about sexiness. It was about it being boring and generic in a way that didn't suit her personality. Blizzard only changed it because they agreed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So are her shoulders though, so maybe it's not a question of crookedness but of pose/posture instead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I liked the part where you misunderstood the argument that person made about Tracer's pose, which was "it doesn't fit her charcter", and not "SHE HAS AN ASS!!1! TRIGGERED!!!!!!".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually like T.Racer I think its her best skin!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tracer makes that pose in the very first animated trailer in front of children.  There. That pose matches her character. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ever seen Starship Troopers?

It's the face Denise Richards makes when she's concentrating.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's not allowed to face away from cameras. It's not in her style.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm upset because it's not a sexual pose. She is literally just looking at you over her shoulder. It's a simple pose, one that many other characters in overwatch also have. It's optional. It's an unlockable. Nobody is forced to use it. Tracer is over the age of 20. Her highlight neon colored ass isn't doing anything in the pose, she is literally just standing but apparently that's "out of character". That's why I'm upset. If I wear tight fitting pants to the gym, what does that say about MY character, Blizzard?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You would think you guys have never seen a woman's ass before
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"The last pose didn't do a good enough job of showing off how toned her ass is."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So this guy had a girlfriend. And she was with him. And he decided to fuck a grill. Why do these people get to have girlfriends but not me? How is this fair?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Huh... so that's what she looks like when she's not covered in mayo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now you understand why the Zulu was kicking her ass through her face.  A Zulu never forgets. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she already know how to sing? I've yet to play the first one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That look on Tracer's face... she obviously does *not* ship it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So does no one see that the woman is actually standing with her arms in front of her, clasped together?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok... but how does she look now? She makes a different pose? or did they give her a flat ass?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But in all seriousness, that pose wasn't even remotely sexually suggestive at all.

The post made it seem like she was twerking and doing a duck face. She's just standing the other way, with her hip shifted a bit. That's it.

3 other characters have the "Over the shoulder" pose, doing the same thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It doesn't build on her character in literally any way. None of the generic poses do. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She isn't perking out her butt, she is just standing looking over her shoulder. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Although she's known as a redhead, her natural hair color is blonde. It was Judd Apatow who suggested she change her hair color for Superbad (2007) and she liked it so much that she decided to keep it.

____________________ TOPIC 18 ______________________________

Plot Twist. Ellie actually died and Joel is hallucinating that she is still alive. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This girl is amazing, quite possibly my new favourite person .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the most emotional scene was Joel and Ellie discussing Sarah after she runs away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because it's *her* revenge mission. Joel has no horse in that race, but he'll go wherever Ellie goes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The latter. There's a part in the game where [she goes back to when she's a teenager.](/spoiler)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If the thought of this woman being President doesn't terrify you, you are a lost cause and you deserve everything you get in life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chorrol. You may remember the wife strolling around town with the dogs following her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I called it. What a bunch of wacky monkeys. And she blames the game. Blame yourself you moron!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not so much the warp, the fact she knew it was a whistle and exactly where it was
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't that lady in The Avalanches music video? I've seen her before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well actually Ellie had no idea of the procedure and what would take place. she had no idea that this was going to kill her and neither did Joel until Marlene told him this, so Ellie had not accepted anything. It pushes him to fight for Ellie because he doesn't want to lose yet another person he cares about so he is willing to sacrifice humanity for his own personal emotions and then has to outright lie to the face of the cure for humanity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is no amount of preperation for her inbox. Its gone forever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whoa... what's wrong with her freckles?!

Edit: Oh... they're make-up. Now I'm impressed :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's okay. I nuked Megaton city, then was so shocked a certain someone hadn't died that I lost her and had to spend time hunting her down to kill her again. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
she also takes a shower, and  swims...god dammit metalgear make up your god damn mind
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is the exact moment she stops thinking video games are cool. ;'(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that poor woman just wanting to get to the other building had to die
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I disagree. 

Its a matter of perspective and how you think about "the greater good" overall. Many would argue that if you had to kill even 1 innocent person to achieve world peace, then you shouldnt. Others would gladly murder a million people if it meant peace for billions. Although I agree that Joel wasnt necessarily being Selfless when he decided to rescue Ellie, it was character growth and its a bit superficial to label it only as selfish. 

Joel from the beginning of the game would have gladly murdered Ellie if it meant a cure for the disease. Towards the end of the game he starts to change back into who he was in the prologue. He is regaining his humanity. He wanted Ellie to live because of what she means to him. 

&gt;He didn't save Ellie because he loves her and wants her to be happy, he saved her purely for himself.

Its a bit of both. By regaining his humanity he wants Ellie to grow up and have the type of life that he had with Sarah. He lies to her about what happened because he is a flawed person, but saving her was more complicated Joel being selfish. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't take her on the final mission cause I thought someone would die. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Start playing Dota2. I swear to god, if you're a woman and pick support (or don't), everyone will die to protect you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Oh my god, is she dead?"

"I'll go make sure"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jeez man stop crying like a little girl and accept it like i did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't be the only person to see the ending and think that Ellie knows she's being lied to and accepts it because she ultimately got what she wanted?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But then I saw pamella. I have never seen woman so beautiful. I must find her in her underwater panties.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everyone seems to think she hates the Fireflies because they killed Joel and he's now some sort of hallucination, but I think Joel is alive and well and he is manipulating her. I think Joel will end up as the "bad guy" in this one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This. This is the best. I just hope she has the right traits, or out she goes...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh my god this is amazing. I hope Bill Gates sees this and sees how happy he made this girl. Bill Gates is seriously the best rich guy ever. Literally the richest man in the world and he does so many good things with his wealth. :')
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you really think Ellie didn't know? She's not gullible, knows Joel has had a hell of time, she knows he's lying. Does she accept the lie and try to convince herself, does she instead try to escape Joel, seeing what he has become? Or does she resent him but continue to follow as he's all she has?
The ambiguity of the ending makes it powerful. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I don't recall how far along she is, but she wasn't all woman at the start.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the music for this game. I loved it enough to convince my wife to use it as the song she walked down the aisle last year. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not to mention that Joel chose to safe Ellie over saving the world. He'd rather be in Hell with her than be in the world he grew up knowing without her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell do you mean she has an egg?!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I knew that was a woman! I knew right when I saw it and watched it a few turns to see what made me think that. I thought, "is this some really mundane male superpower or just my imagination?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she'd already saved once, she wouldn't even have to do that with auto-save.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he DID save the girl and follow her to make sure she got home safe.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably cause she thinks it likes her too since it shows up all the god damn time. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What does she think will happen if a full tortilla gets thrown away?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So that is why the female cat cries in pain during copulation...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess it truly stands up to it's name of No Man's Sky

Because no man or woman for that matter is willing to play the damn thing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The first damn scene in the last of us [when Sara gets shot and poor Joel is in denial and trying to wake her up and she slowly drifts away in his arms.](/spoiler)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's hoping she regulates games as well as she regulates banks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I fucking hate Williams she's so dumb and don't deserve to be alive! Yeah I said it. she's so clueless! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was hoping they would all turn and follow it over her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your damn right! Now we just need to get my girlfriend to understand it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course they are going to blame the game when she was being dumb.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No clue. My best guess is he was playing music, and she probably drunkenly interrupts him. But that's just a guess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How does she do it? She poops so everyone may knows?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh good grief. This one made me say "woooow" out loud. This woman is freaking beautiful...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also she wasn't getting impaled every other scene. Unless [you're into that sort of thing](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the fireflies have killed Joel, and we're getting a 'The Sixth Sense' treatment, Ellie is the only one interacting with Joel in the game and his death is what is motivating her actions.

____________________ TOPIC 19 ______________________________

Please tell me the metroid game where "the zero suit is all she wears".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is dumb. The game is already historically inaccurate as fuck. Might as well add female soldiers too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should have made a version of that game where she was traversing Dante's Inferno called "Where in the hell is Carmen Sandiego?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Samus is the girl. Metroid is the little floaty thing infront of her :p.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aliens take rib of Adam, make clone from bone in female form of adam for reproduction? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looking like that she can call herself whatever she wants.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Habe you ever played Metroid? It's canon. Samus is a girl. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a set of Copic markers and my girl has a set of prismas so it was a mix
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But why wouldn't you want space between? Boobies need to breathe woman!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No but she is female and has some definition in game so, of coarse, rule 34
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love all of these but I really want to see like an Amazonian samus. I always pictured her as being built like she hulk. Like 6'2"and powerful as fuck. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I suppose she does look more like her this time. Still a dickload of enhancements though :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plot twist, she thinks he's just playing a simple video game...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean more that she's not absurdly or unrealistically tall.  Amazonian isn't how I'd describe her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her assets were a lot more pronounced when she was a sprite IMO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's some great form there by the girl...


but yeah.... not really something i'd want on my body.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Duh...it's a type of girl scout cookie. The best cookies ever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ew she doesn't look nearly as good without the beard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it wouldn't be as good with women because it is historically inaccurate...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plot twist: she doesn't get into the game and never likes it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean is she supposed to be Metroid's Seamus Aran?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she play the originals aka Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake? And she ever played NES Metal Gear and Snake's Revenge?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[This]( is official artwork of her, you could see how easily rule 34 would get into it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They're not trying to be historically accurate, except you know, no female soldiers for whatever reason.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost like the US congress. A bunch of men talking about how women should feel about their bodies and representation. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The suit is actually very form fitting, and maybe adds an inch or two to her height. She does stand at a fairly tall 6'3 out of suit however.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Games are terrible because they portray women with unrealistic proportions. No one actually looks like... @o@
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ummmmm joker doesn't have a last name. And I doubt he's the type of guy to take her last name 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Without the wings, she looks more like a Zero Suit Samus Medic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
...Samus. Her name is Samus, Metroids are the shit she kills.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They have one, and dozens of her. Rei will pilot Eva 01.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you were a body builder yourself, you'd like her. 

I'm going to guess you're not. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to see her with Zero suit if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tira is the type of girl that turns me off when I go down on a girl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can also get a [7 meter body pillow of ~~best girl~~ some snake girl for $115](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Samus in her 8bit glory?  Not unless you go [justin bailey](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And would she even have the cannon without the full suit?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her face after she tells her what she wants. Fucking golden xD
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, alright, let me just call her up, I'll get back to you.

Alright, I'm back. She said no.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most legit response. Honestly though I'm just playin. No offence.  You're a good sport. Or whatever the female version of sport is. Should still be sport right? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That looks a little bit like Lana Beniko. May too skilled/powerful, though. Can't be her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she gets a lot of love and recognition. Just not the type that she wants...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plot twist, she thinks he's just playing a simple video game...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But her lower body has no shape at all really. It looks unnatural. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like a female version of Cloud.

Even though Cloud is kind of already a female version of Cloud
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*ahem* You mean you'd like to show her your *solid snake*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She seems so badass now, even though she already was a badass. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like they seem to be a symbiote or something they morph to the very shape of her body
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, but it's a bit of a stretch to call her a badass when she didn't do a single thing besides that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy in the suit in metroid is is a girl...

Actually, probably because her "no no no" reminded me of [this.](

Is she awesome?  I want to be awesome.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I first laughed then realized she's probably going through some issues in her life bad enough that she has to pray. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i just realized that james was a total womens man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I saw this as a joke against weebs, not women. Just me?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope, just sheer absent mindedness. I love her so much haha.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
haha she looks funny and a little bit sexy ;) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not telling him to break up with her or get a wedding ring.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awesome. I'd love to do something like this at my place but my SO is kinda picky about decor and she's not into video games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As in A through L (El) from "The girl who circumnavigated fairyland in a ship of her own making"?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
looks more like a D than the one in Disney, so she's doing fine 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm actually in tears laughing and my girlfriend thinks I'm nuts for laughing so much.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 It seemed funny to me that the sunset she saw from her patio and the one I saw from the back steps was the same one. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she will be, pretty sure Blindspot has a break in filming for the holidays.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You forgot that the woman goes on a homicidal rampage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rocket league, my girlfriend can't stop playing and neither can I
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well,  all these men think they can come up in her sky.  It's no man's sky.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if he got her a puppy?  Who doesn't fall apart over a puppy?!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How would she use this against you anyhow? Doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't you just laugh it off. You probably have no girlfriend. Which is totally fine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's funny man. I'm glad people remembered her name haha
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She was a lot better this year than in the past. A lot of people seem to like her. I think her jokes fall flat a lot of the time, but she actually did well this year.

You are correct.  We never see her swim (as that would cause her to drown).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ultimate wedding faux pas to propose to your girlfriend during a wedding reception in front of everyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get her another ring and see if PSVR shows up too
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
While I am more of a Star Trek girl myself, I do like star wars a lot. I'll have a look at it. Thank you! :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to be with my Star Wars girl {[:'^(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awww that's so adorable and kind....

I'm still not going to watch or subscribe to her though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This girl is from London, so I have no idea where she's got it from haha.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your girlfriend reminds me of [Pakelika from the Kottonmouth Kings]( (RIP)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are you so bitter, OP? Did the mean girls make fun of your hat? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget the ring girl! Can't have a boxing ring without a ring girl!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks to me like he's saw a spider and is doing a girly side hop.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just want to see the rest of her hat...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Funny how she tried to use Jamie Foxx to back her side when I just watched a video of him, snoop Dogg and wiz khalifa playing battlefield one
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awesome, just dye her hair pink and make her [smirk]( and she'll be perfect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's always fun to see someone passionate about something. So entertaining to watch. :) Like the star wars mask woman! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; You fought valiantly. But you are just a man.

Uh uh. A woman.

_You have been visited by the Cult of the FemShep_.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what kind of wife plays video games without her wedding ring... a bit suspicious
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you're an ass, but that was a humorous description. I know a girl like that. you forgot to mention the pintrest obsession.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha yeah I've done the same as Pharah. Totally forgot about her knockback rocket though. Man this game is fun!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha it's funny cuz it's pink and girl and it say his hahahafuckoffareyoutenyearsold? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How many girls you know in total? How many of of those girls you know well enough that you know they definitely don't play?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's kind of funny really. Over here guys and girls played with both of them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha my girlfriend and I have so much fun recreating this. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has a good sense of humour. We both laughed when she did that 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a girl but it's fine I don't mind being called man I guess. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess if you play a female character it would be "No Ma'am's Sky"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This illustrates so clearly the shenanigans women have to put up with with guys. 

____________________ TOPIC 21 ______________________________

At first, I thought it was a pic of her and the other was in game...I was like SPOT THE FUCK ON!  Still some awesome cosplay thoygh!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine if she played video games with no PC or console either, that'd be crazy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh she's seen me play a ton, she is just hesitant to play console games (I have it on ps4)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pharah is also good if she is unexpected, especially if they also have a Reinheardt.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is the first one bad? Is she not supposed to heal?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every fucking time.

Pharah is my main but man is her ultimate super easy to counter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I main her but lucio, Mai, Winston, 76, and phara are still played 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FemShep is my Shep! One of the best female heroes out there! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No way... it is definitely "Marla" its female handwriting to match the female name!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she thought it was a PC not a PS4
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For a good* Misty cosplay

I've seen a bunch of girls forgo that last item in their cosplay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But then if she's under defense her status as a shittier torbjorn is exposed. Under support she doesn't need to be good for anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My favorite tank. Or as my teammates call her "wth why u no pick Reinhardt?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She looks like she has seen some shit. Great cosplay though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure he means she doesn't look "Chinese". Which is a fair call. Because she's Korean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her Rapunzel cosplay is absurdly perfect. It's kind of insane how perfect a lot of her cosplays are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; they will/ should focus her before you.

Not if its my team.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
These cosplay are always the hottest things I've ever seen, the female ones
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Okay I agree that a PC for gaming is better than any console. However, that does not mean consoles are bad. Besides, she wanted a PS4 so let her have a PS4. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not bad, not bad, but she looks more like she's cosplaying Jessica Rabbit cosplaying Jessie of Team Rocket.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd take the bundle unless you already own Spelunky and Skullgirls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's an awesome costume, but she is way too short for samus.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she calls herself Azzy, I'd say she was made to cosplay Overwatch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Best D.Va Cosplay I've ever seen. They should make her look like this in-game!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just counter him with Moonraker Elite (b)...the girl is Oddjob-short for some reason.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How could she not like overwatch!? I feel like that game is for everyone 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most of these are fantastic but Taylor Swift is an abomination compared to the Yeezus next to her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is an Overwatch cosplay? I thought she was doing a Water Bender cosplay...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's already the most attractive hero but she's also Korean so it's not even fair to the others there
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I seriously doubt anyone has ever said any of those things to you. I've played a lot of Overwatch and I have never had someone on my team be disrespectful to a female, most people just want to win.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair she's probably never seen it before and thinks it's cosplay
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you think you know better than a team of 24 professional analysts?


(Scroll down a bit untill you see a woman)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nifty.

It looks like her damage may be a little to much for a support though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
IMO best match 3 game out there. If you're into match 3 games, give it an honest try. The girls are hilarious and there are awesome secret characters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah - I guess she would be a better defense rather than support hero.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean she is a cosplayer so I don't think that's a factor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How many good Cindy cosplayers are there? I've seen like 5 that look really freaking similar to her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well either way she is a shit team player a banana could literally support the team better than she can
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That early, I think the majority say 6 was the best.  They have 7 and 9 on Android and Iphones for fairly cheap now.  Should get her one of those.  I absolutely loved both of those.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was the best kind of support, she wanted to help you in more ways than IT support...js.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
League of Legends champion. Here is the video Riot made when they released her:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She will, the PC will take out his locket and look at her at the start of every match
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's cosplaying a crazy girl, so she's actually spot on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
people complain when I pick widowmaker... they don't understand how useful she is to defense and offense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
low effort game, low effort girlfriend, low effort video, low effort post, low effort life
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love playing her. I don't understand why more people don't. She is not the best tank but she has this tank / support thing going on that is very strong and her damages can be huge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For sure, I usually play reaper, and I rarely have trouble with Mei unless she's really good. So I'm sure a lot of people just don't know how to deal with the matchup. A good Mei will make it tough on reaper, and a good reaper will make it tough on mei
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking she kind of already looks like junkrat.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is Zarya even doing in this picture, she can tank better than Reinhardt.

C.S. Lewis also sent Susan to hell because she stopped believing in Narnia.

I had a friend who had her ventrilo set to say "The roflcopter goes whooshwhooshwhooshwhoosh" as the pronunciation of her name back in the day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; women are not special

Except apparently they are since they get drawn as a piece of ass to be lusted for far more often than men do.

&gt; Its incredibly narcissistic to expect strangers to care for you personally.

It's incredibly narcissistic to expect an industry to ignore the desires of customers that aren't you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then I guess there's no issue as she's doing exactly as she pleases, hooray freedom
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I play the most sexualized possible female that looks as close to my wife as possible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's there, but I left it open for people who might be seeking desirable men. 

Sure, for girls gamers there is no limit to the selection but as they say "The odds are good, but the goods are odd."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would suggest you put the video games up and start doing things she likes before you become a cuck!

This is the tricky thing. If the piston can be stopped by Chell applying a force then it should be even if portals are there. It's not some something that can be kinesthetically intuitive, but the downward movement of the piston depends on the net forces being applied. If moving the piston downward lessens the space Chell can occupy and causes her to compress, then her compression creates a resistive, "upward" force against the downward force of the piston. If that resistive force is enough to stop the moving piston, then it will. 

This is of course assuming Newtonian type physics even work anymore which they don't if portals exist. You gotta remember portals defy every physical law we have.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mind is warped. I was expecting her to get on her knees. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Please explain how a feisty, energetic, and fun loving character tauntingly looking over her shoulder is so widely out of character that it warrants being removed from the game despite the developers thinking it was in character enough to add in the first place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ahhhhh, I thinkgen about her all the time.

Sometimes I thinkgen about her in public.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's completely baloney that when ever a woman does anything remotely successful someone somewhere is going to say it's only because she's a woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And after you get her back, there's no acknowledgment or anything that she's back. She's just there.

Good.  You continue to please me--spirituality and sexually.

You are granted this wisdom:  a woman's feet contain her essence.

Cause people can change. Marriage seems to drastically change a lot of women (not all). Perhaps men too but I don't have anecdotal experience for that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well for starters. I would guarantee that if you surveyed women, the majority would want circumcised because it is the norm.

Vermina doesn't force you to do anything though, everything that happens it that her staff whispers to kill someone to you and you can decide if to do it or not.

Not sure about Dagon though.

Does that single eyeball belong to a girl named Kayla?

I didn't expect her to be real.

The thumbnail made her look like a drawing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's alright she doesn't do it nearly enough to the point where I believe it'd become a problem. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No idea, but I'm going to guess it happens when she is "on fire".

Another dubious connection to The Hunger Games.

*conspiracy intensifies*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Women wouldn't have boob sculpted breastplates because women weren't knights.

Women wouldn't have boob sculpted breastplates because those would have been much more difficult to forge.

As for deflecting certain blows inwards, that wouldn't really matter. A sword isn't going to pierce a breastplate no matter how much you deflect it inwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That happened back in the past though. As an adult, Link had to give back the ocarina so she could reverse everything that happened as a result of Ganondorf's campaign
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only thing that would make this better is if her nipples were hard.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell, I wouldn't mind her saying "OMGWTFBBQ!" while ulting or something
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
fwiw, you shouldn't use vaseline as lube.  Not a good idea (for women).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thats a hell of love from my girl, you wouldn't understand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's all well and dandy, Good for him/her, but it shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.

see I would expect Meridia to send some people to take Dawnbreaker if I'm a vampire, but she doesn't :(

^(I'm usually a vampire when I get it)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Either that or constipation, she's perfectly fine, she regularly goes to the vet and doesn't have any problems with her bowel movements believe me, she thinks it's a game because she knows I'm going to chase her if she tries it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even so, unless she's changed Java's 4gb hard limit of RAM for any single process then it's going to blow.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They weren't even allowed to have that panel without forcing them to find a female panelist in the first place. They should have got Ouya's CEO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What I'm saying is hiring a special team to focus on just her when she's already been exonerated is a violation of due process. It singles her out for special persecution on no grounds other than paranoid conspiracy theories.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

That was her perfect opportunity to bust an insane moonwalk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
take the right course of action.


play in her room and force her to watch

I know a family that literally did this. Their daughter has schizophrenia and sometimes talks to herself in public. They got her a (possibly non-functioning?) BT to make it less conspicuous.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at the male vs female character lineup for that game, and you'll see immediately that she was right...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why no girls are allowed. You wouldn't understand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe she thought sending it would send the original, and then she wouldn't have it anymore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't that not matter since her initial drop begins when the portals are stationary? Moving them closer together just condenses the space in which she's falling, and even then the space of the entire fall is still infinite, so it's not really condensing anything at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What did she expect?  She doesn't even have any guns. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was that one guys girlfriend that liked portal, maybe you should show her portal.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He actually delivers a really swift and forceful kick, probably breaking her back in the process. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't and wouldn't like anyone to "tell" the developers to make a female link, they should never be pressured to do so, but I like the idea of just reminding them that the possibility is open if they want to go down that path.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl on said ad is not even from the game. .-. If she is it's a ripoff because she's from Perfect World International. &gt;.&gt;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No idea who the hell Cindy is but I like her already 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If any of the recipients are females, and not "Sirs" does this letter become null?

____________________ TOPIC 23 ______________________________

Why would someone want her to be a role model?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, it was concept art. She's now not chubby, and every fat girl wants to be Mei now.  

If we start believing conceprt art then we're all gunna be disappointed, because so much concept art is better than the real thing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't worry, you'll never end up with a girlfriend with that attitude
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You and /u/Circasftw inspired me, I put your words her eon imgur to share with people.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure if this tainted or improved the image I had of her. Either way l, neat concept. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget to appreciate it as she tried and exchange if possible :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And it was based on literally nothing, just her feelz.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where the hell did she even find the time or person to give her a tattoo?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Talented girl".

Since when is copying the art style of an anime character a talent? 
Is being pretty a talent?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who ever will invent this kind of technology, he or she is going to be a millionaire. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
'Every girl wants a piece of you'.. Is this some kind of splatter film?

Ajay does too, but Amita looks *nothing* like she's supposed to. She's got the tattoo but that's it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet another unrealistic standard of beauty for women in video games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but why are you assuming that girls only play bejeweled in the first place?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let's dispel with this fiction that Lana doesn't know what she's doing. She knows exactly what she's doing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No idea what Geraltina, Rivia or Bruxa are, but that is one beautiful woman
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this apolo justice or does she also appear in the other games? Im on Apolo justice atm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've had quite a lot of women say pretty good things about my booty. Women definitely like the booty.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Having 2 of the same last name is one thing, but at least she wasn't named "Sarmiento Sarmiento Sarmiento". 

Also why doesn't she just shorten it to one Sarmiento? Does she actually go with the double last name?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
With that attitude no woman would get with you, not even if you were TheLastDudeguy on Earth 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think people need to check usernames more. His literally says Man_AMA. What were you supposed to do? Assume he's a girl and not ask anything?! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; But not even the best one I've seen.

&gt;considering she's taking a selfie 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's actually just a gif of her playing in a perfect loop, fooling everyone... :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She should look around, see if she can form some sort of a rudimentary lathe..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Vivec is a hermaphrodite (Both sexes). They even had concept art for female looking Vivec. 



The 36 sermons also talk about him giving birth after sexy times with Molag Bal. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your girlfriend is truly an inspiration to people who doubt their ability to play a video game everywhere.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is weird to see guys these days refer to themselves as girlfriend these days
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And she appeared on talk shows to promote the game

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You don't count Cinderella?  

Either way, you asked about grunts, and there are definitely female grunts in both games. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I have 1 tattoo and it's my little girls handprint and her name.

What an original idea! that tattoo must not suck at all!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was back in the Fearless era, [she's grown up]( since her teens.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going to assume by 'model girlfriend' you mean you assembled her yourself out of plastic
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the way she goes, bub. It's the way she goes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she says something along the lines of "I think it's time justice had a nap"

EDIT: From the wiki, the actual line is "I think justice could use a little nap"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is a really beautiful piece of art :) Tell her that I said that :P
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  concepts like 'male' and 'female' don't apply to her species.

 &gt;her


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This was taken completely out of context. It's a very popular Ted talk in which she is promoting video games and saying that more people should actually be playing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was talking about them in terms of best girl you know...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not what she meant when she said double sided
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


This is the concept art shown off on her release, she was always chubby.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He wouldn't get that label if he were a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ummm................ I believe the Japanese style name is "Ayanami Rei". And she's Japanese.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have no idea what that judge is smoking because she's obviously the spitting image of Trevor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the whole thing was obvious from the start to her. I mean, come on, he wants her to play a game based on the spots they have been while he's recording her...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but does she have any idea what those things are?

doubtful
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the japanese term for an intersex person - usually depicted as a girl with a cock and vag.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe that I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks good. But wouldn't it make more sense if she just chopped furiously?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Didn't she do a lot of the other DBZ characters as well? Anyway Japan Dub &gt; American Dub.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess I can't. But I mean if she was overweight or something

____________________ TOPIC 24 ______________________________

Would have looked good if she had kept to Claw's actual costume seeing as he has long blonde hair too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
their exact conversation:

&gt; her: do you have to wear that helmet?

&gt; him: no. ... but it helps!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's also that chick, I can't remember her name. The pyromancy lady that you give clothes to, but if you just give her some boots or a helmet, she's just wearing scraps.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He-man runs around in underwear AND shows his nipples. I'd say that's a bit more revealing than most women in video games, albeit not by much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The witchers go dress up in Yennifer's clothing and try to dial a girl using her megascope. Instead, they call an old dignitary while he's on the shitter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also she likes it when you run around in your underwear. She's the only woman that appreciates your body.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[You are never too old to make a Let's Play of Skyrim and Fallout 4 either.]( Note that she is 79.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then why not keep her looking the same but in a more revealing outfit 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's always wearing clothes... she's just not always wearing pants.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Reminds me of the old women in skyrim when I installed the cbbe and skimpy clothes mod... Regret
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A crazy hot woman? At a gaming convention? Can someone check for photoshop?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, it's just two pokedudes making some sweet, sweet pokelove. Unless that's a female sandshrew I guess. They could be pegging.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A girl wearing a T-shirt and pants is scantily clad? The fuck man.  You want her in a fully hooded burqa? Omg you can see her arms! Burn her at the fucking stake!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The short hair makes her look a lot like a male.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is she not wearing a shirt?  I'm pretty sure Mcree doesn't expose his chest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As long as they're all hot women. Go for it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
female sylvaris cover up in GW2 because wearing revealing clothes has a stigma
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bangs cut so she can see and an off-center ponytail. The hair is fine.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Give her the Shem sword and then she kills all the lowbies that bother you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, is her shirt painted on or is that just a really well-done cell-shaded look on a tight shirt? I can't tell, but maybe I didn't look at it long enough.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not skimpy enough. We all know what little armor female paladins actually get compared to male counterparts
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because women and rocks are only around to show us thier cleavage...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure that's a girl on the right with short hair and glasses. That's only one though; the game should still be pretty good!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I looked at some screenshots. I'm a bit peeved that it made female armor into battle bikinis, when one of my favorite things about Skyrim was that male and female armor was almost the same.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you make skimpy outfits with hose and garters for women, then men should get them too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That chick has straight up crazy eyes.  Like run the other way, it doesn't matter if she's hot, crazy eyes.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Someone install the mod where she has no clothes on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FFXIV is pretty good about that.

Something that's skimpy on a female character is skimpy on men and something that covers the entire body covers everything on anyone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's in it, just in one of the skins. Right below the statue of liberty and right next to the girl in the bikini. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She has a costume where she wears full body armor 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did she dye her hair or is she just wearing a wig?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the girl in blue is super hot. I would love to get nerdy with her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's the name of one of her sprays. Go through them thinking 'hotness' and you'll know exactly which one I mean!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember the other paintings she did. These are still looking great!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The first thing I thought was why is she pulling her shirt down, it makes it too obvious. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've seen this before yet I still giggled like a little girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, most bikini armor in previous TES games were the work of modders and not Bethesda, I think the most revealing vanilla clothes/armor was female Forsworn armor and Nocturnal's robes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're right to nitpick.  The entire outfit is terrible.  She pulls it off because she's hot, but the details of the outfit are way off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't say she isn't hot. I'm just saying that having a dress made entirely of belts is pretty wacky.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cait is used to injecting hard pricks into her. ;D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like my women like I like my coffee...

Hot, sweet and black
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she's still hot; it just looks like she's actually wearing some kind of clothing in Halo 5.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So clear this up, what are you saying, that Kamala is a bad super hero because she isn't wearing latex?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
same, being a hot blonde girl and so lonely is really tuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not about female having clothes, it's about mens not wearing them too.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would also dress like a woman if I got to see Tifa in those clothes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What vault is she in? Cause that's the one I want to be in.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Au contraire, freund. In Daggerfall, there are female armor chestpieces that show tons of cleavage, and Battlespire has full armor chestpieces for males that appear merely as bras for females.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some chick peed in my brother bathtub once, and would not keep her clothes on after re-dressing her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same reason I wear my girlfriend's clothing when she's at work.

____________________ TOPIC 25 ______________________________

They did work on 'getting over her feelings', it was just while she was a child still that they helped her recover.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What I want to know is if she DID get pregnant, would her baby suffer the same time lapse she suffers? would her baby need one of those devices on her chest to keep her baby from fading in and out of different chronological positions? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the cut goes on her boobs, which is weird.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*Wow, she really misses her droid.*. 

"Err, all the time?"  
"You don't want to know".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least they're both adults. Not a teenage girl and a full grown adult. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep my baby sis is 6 and has a tablet and I put an emulator so she can play some of the games I did. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I need to find a woman that comfortable with her body...

But first I need to become a man comfortable with mine...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are people born with both male and female genitalia and people born with neither. Then there are people born with only male or only female. That makes four.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
one of the girls lost her parents and was burnt in a fire.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it was my older then I would. But my younger one is pretty stout. Oddly enough not enough phases her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't ever let this girl become a drug dealer... naw mean?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one who thinks this is a bit excessive for a girl this young?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All I cared about growing up was video games and I've never had any issues getting a girlfriend after hitting the gym almost everyday for a few years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She does know. She just doesn't care and loved it anyways because she feels it's still her child. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This wouldn't be that freaky if she didn't stare like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bae is either a 15yo girl or a 53yo mother of four. I can't decide which.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She'll pat his back and ask if it was that mean old **Hav0k** again and promise to call his mother and tell her a thing or two about good sportsmanship.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Poor little guy seems a bit troubled by that last part, but the old woman just looks on with approval.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because she's adopted doesn't make her any less of a daughter to him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well for one thing, my wife was working when I got the mortgage, she has since had a baby, and for another I got a loan after I got the mortgage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd love a girlfriend wot likes games...

Life's been shitty since the divorce.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should of trusted her and thrown the baby in the oven, it wasn't a real baby and helped lift a curse 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who eats a banana sideways!?

My momma said that's how a good girl does it 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought I was pretty good until I introduced this game to my mother. Fuck me, she was making crazy combos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You KNOW she had it coming. Maybe not right that second but it was coming... all is well in the world now.



WORLDSTARRRRRR
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In Michigan it use to be a misdemeanor to curse in front of women and children. They just got rid of the law December of last year. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She can learn her ABCs and also fictional characters from a generation she will never care about!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not as rough as the second one where my wife promised not to talk to any guys. Like I care.

Then she proceeded to dance with some other guy. I cared a little :'(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Because the old man is talking about how the gym is great because it's full of women.

So, there's something wrong with observing that a gym is full of women?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So... she's like your mother in law?  Or maybe even your own mother?

Edit: Or maybe like the older or younger sister you never had.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think people mean a 11 year old girl overpowering adults regularly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hmm, I doubt two random guys would be allowed to adopt young female children.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because the alternative is giving her half your stuff so she goes away?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess we know where the kid got her IQ from
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have family in Mexico that could help him/her out. ;)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
have you seen her forehead? a wig wouldint last the pounding she would get
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You didn't tell her to no clip?! Bad bad child
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's a good kid who makes an effort to help her single mother as much as she can. Give her a discount.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She want's her baby back, and the chef wants some baby back ribs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love seeing stuff like this, look how happy she is to be making something she things her dad/family enjoys!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, but like, I don't say both my parents last names when I say my full name. I only say my dad's last name. Did her parents hyphenate their last names even though they're the same or something?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It seriously looks like those knockers help her get the weight up. Inertia FTW
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Giving family recipes to people without actually giving the full recipe away... I don't know. Its her thing, I just eat cookies.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[My dearest Phariah. Every mother hopes for a better life for her daughter...'](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a Caterpie, by the way. She then says that her father has been basically raising them both as daughters.

Interesting family.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The fuck?! That's horrible. Man, in my play through she helps out at Kaer Morhen, and then goes on her merry way. This is a bit confronting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Agreed, I can only imagine the soreness of her lady bits at the end of the day

Like a cheese wire trying to cut a ham in half 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
...so she has her baby right there on the lawn?

Seems a bit...primordial...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can you cut her into 4 slices? I don't think I could eat 8.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Keep on being a good parent and don't think about what other people think of your parenting. You're raising her, not them.

I get owned by her in quick play, but I hear she sucks at competitive level. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm hating that people feel the need to try Anna because she's new.. Yeah she's new.. Pick a player you know or we'll lose
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck. Gives me hope that there are girls out there who play games other than Call of duty
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And neither does it help that her first name is Rain.

Plenty of females to choose from in the last 4 Call of Duty games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Terraria maybe? My girlfriend really enjoyed playing that with me, and she doesn't game at all!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I learned it as "look both ways before crossing". Maybe she looked both ways when she was already crossing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I also killed her when first playing. I was too far in the game to start over when I realized. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her bio is that she's a former pro starcraft player.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Punishing the truly skilled players is one thing. But it feels like she was able to be played by more than truly skilled players. I bet she'll still be able to be unstoppable with truly skilled players.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a 8 year old daughter that loves playing CoD with me, but I don't want her exposed to the shit talking or total thrashing we would get playing online. This feature allows us to play together at a level she can enjoy.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm super excited for it and my girlfriend is having me build her a PC specifically for it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's "hours of content" and "non linear gameplay" and most "girl gamers" I know actually love it... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hopefully an expansion pack for women comes out before then. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Game looks retarded to me. Fuck multiplayer. Single player campaign or go outside and fuck a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunately shooter games are infested with fuckwads. Games like WoW seem to be much friendlier to women. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Totally. Maybe even FF XIII. Just keep an eye on her and help her out if she needs it. Also, make sure she knows if she gets stuck on a part to backtrack a little and level her people more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meg's been at RT for like a year and a half, and her and Ryan didn't really start doing anything together until last year. What are you on about?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What she means is that the cave itself is not natural. I can build an entrance like that around a natural cave and it would still be a natural cave with a metal outline. The cave was dug out by the forerunners which means it's an artificial cave, not one that naturally formed by itself. Her deductive arguments are still valid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's nice if you listen to it as overall creative music. I have one of her CDs that's easy to relax and zone out to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The progressive woman got old looking quick. Makes those ads less funny somehow 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend does her own nails, similar levels of elaborateness, for about $10AUD all up, which is like $7USD.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Miz and Mayrse are far more A-list than whomever those girls are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good point. I was generalizing from my experience with it. My wife is a yoga instructor, so I go to classes with her, which are usually the advanced ones, and they are hard. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ofc she is gonna be op its not like we have the option to upgrade abilities and gear  or practice with her so they gave us end game version of her for our easy use.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am working through tower of the swallow now. I think lady in the lake is the last, right? Outside of the graphic novels?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, the reason usually is that the girls are older than they look. Is it still weird? Maybe. At least they're fictional. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Easily explainable. When Bishop tries to set the bird down to pick up Ripley and Newt, she somehow scuttled onto the ship. Thus, when they thought they had reached relative safety, out pops Mother Goose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would give the first a pass. I loved it myself, but the second is just so much better, funnier and easier to get in to. If she has a hard time learning the fundamentals of FPS have her play Gaige, since she it super easy to learn.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same. I heard that her difficulty scales with how good you did in previous races. I might just replay the game and suck a little more in glitter gulch mine so I can get what's rightfully mine
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I learned anything from /r/askreddit it's that she was flirting, but now she thinks you're a scrub.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tell her to remake that 64 to have the expansion pack slot!!!!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bloodborne is fun.. sure it's hard and OP's new to games, but the game is a masterpiece both graphically and in gameplay and playing a game like bloodborne will shape him/her to be a better gamer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does she like any of the other LEGO series games?

If she wants to try something different:

Fable

Bastion

Terraria
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that is only in single player action games. RPGs, Moba, RTS, platformer, etc games have always had tons of female characters.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand single player, but I don't see the issue in including female soldiers in the multiplayer. The more options the better when it comes to customizing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She even made sure her handwriting was nice instead of hastily scribbled.  Definitely immersed as others have said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she can certainly explore my hidden riches

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe an MMORPG? I'm thinking of Wildstar, it's got a good f2p model which gives you access to most if not all of the game content for free and locks stuff like extra char slots, extra AH slots, cosmetics and so on behind paywalls (you start with 3 char slots by default, I think).

Game is a mixture between sci-fi WoW and GuildWars2 style combat. Quite well executed, pretty good quests, nice zones, nice art style... It feels kinda like WoW 2.0.

I figure an MMO is going to introduce her to a lot of aspects of PC gaming, but Wildstar is designed to ease players into that kind of stuff. You start off with a small, quite linear tutorial zone, then go out to a bigger, less linear tutorial zone and you are slowly introduced to grouping with multiple people, trading, professions, all that stuff.

It should introduce her to many aspects of gaming without overwhelming her (especially if you play together so you can show her what's what)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It depends on why she doesn't like FPS (it make some people seasick).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Break up with her and call me up please. I'd love to learn more:)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it looks great, a zombie killer can't be killing all the time, she has to be laid back and relaxed no?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But still not easy enough to do a better job than OP's girl. 

either it's not as easy than you are making out, or she is better than you at something which requires no skill, which explains the salt. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't we already. Wow he's a lady killer... Or she is going to break so many hearts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She already helps me with my turn-based strategy games.  "Oh, there's one over there Papa!  Don't forget him!"

When she's old enough.. I want her to play through the same type of graphical revolution I did (some classics like FF6, Secret of Evermore/Mana, Illusions of Gaia, Super Mario World 1/2, Warcraft II or Starcraft I - maybe some Ultima or we can play on an emulation server for EQ or WoW ;p) 

I really can't wait.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Diablo 3 is a fun game. My wife and I play it every now and then and she's not a gamer at all. It's easy and you can reduce the difficulty. Plus it's fun for me because I can start leveling up a new character. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But she may like different stuff than you. Does she think a particular game looks fun?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no girls player video games online, everyone is a man and/or pretending to be a girl for items
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's your build? Maybe you should do some chalice dungeons until you're a high enough level for her. It could also be that you're a defensive player, which isnt good for bloodborne.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My non-gamer(ish) wife really struggles to control FPS games due to the set up with dual sticks. She can do it slowly, but under duress she gets stressed and struggles to aim properly.

Due to not really playing anywhere near enough games (especially this genre) she's never really gotten over that.

How does your nongamer girlfriend cope with the controls and sticks?

____________________ TOPIC 27 ______________________________

I'm tempted to get this game but 4 characters and no women or non- humans seems a bit odd for a Final Fantasy game.

Usually there's at least a love interest.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Triss is also a little bit rapey. I mean she knew all of Geralt's back story when he lost his memory and basically just didn't tell him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 No, i'm waiting for someone to get Amy Henning and have her finish the story in one last game. And maybe resurrect Tony Jay while they're at it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's how the DLC should be played; Hearts of Stone can be played alongside the main storyline. The DLC quest will already be in your logbooks so you can see when you are approaching the appropriate level to start it. For me, this was about the time I was getting ready to head to Skellege, but it also depends on how many of the side quest she you've been picking up.    

Blood and Wine, is best done after you've completed the main plot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just killed the dragon at kynesgrove and she already ded
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They very clearly don't. Geralt would go to the ends of the earth for Ciri, as would Vesemir. Hard to justify that if they don't care for her immensely. Love, happiness, hatred, sadness, mourning - multiple witchers show some or all of these emotions throughout the story.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can do everything you can't do in real life, like ~~casting magic and talking to~~ girls
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Knights on the right are Ornstein and Smough, a duo boss from the Dark Souls series, I've no idea who the girls are. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A better example would be the second book, spoiler:

After escaping from the hunger games, she returns to district 12 and it's been completely destroyed by bombs. Luckily, all the characters whose names you can remember made it out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or the little girl with a staff who is reading a spell book.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now we all know Telltales is going to make us help her sever it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I tried to name a mushroom that looked like a female condom Femdomius earlier but even that didn't get through the filter. Multidongus worked for the multiple penis mushroom though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same, she is the least interesting Final Fantasy lead character ever. So bland, boring and dull.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Her ability lets her travel almost anywhere, could definite take a glimpse of another world, that is not a part of Witcher world at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We don't like to think about it but it's probable that Yen has had some strange in the years her and Geralt were apart.

She wanted to not see each other for a while since she felt stifled by the djinni's spell, after all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[IIRC, it's said in the books that she dies when she's quite old, after becoming dean of the Oxenfurt university of medicine.](/spoiler)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not so much an illusion, she changes her body with magic iirc. All sorceresses do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also sometimes Booker is a girl and Elizabeth is a guy, and sometimes both at once.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Absolutely get her Fable 2 or 3. 1 is more of an RPG, 2 is probably exactly what you're looking for
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, Triss' character has quite a bit of development over the course of the games. She pretty well realizes she's been incredibly manipulative of Geralt and feels horrible for it by Witcher 3. As opposed to Yennefer who's personality is essentially unchanged from the books.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't want to hate on your waifu, but Quiet is by far the worst female character of 2015.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least it didn't tell you to go buy more DLC to expand on her legend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Witcher 3 happens a few months after Witcher 2. All of the games are set after books. [When do you remember her dying, because she's also in Witcher 1. She doesn't appear in Witcher 2 though, so maybe you assumed she died?](/spoiler)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Arkham Knight.

The DLC added nothing to the actual story of the game and was just a little side story with Batgirl. 

There are other games that come out finished that don't have a season pass. Like Bloodborne.

Witcher 3 also.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Final Fantasy 8 Sorceress, got all the way to her with a HERO spell (makes you invincible), and she just wiped it away like nothing....fuck you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did you read the books? I quite like her. I mean, Geralt is my favorite fictional character. The whole series is really about Ciri. And Geralts adventures trying to find her. Kinda like Witcher 3!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So i think you are going to be playing as multiple characters in this one. In the first trailer ther is a robo girl named kara . At the end they both say my name is kara/ connor and this is our story. Makes me think the story is going to be about more than one person.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure it wasn't Keira, the blond Temerian sorceress on Fyke Isle? You can kill her if you royally fuck up that quest (imho).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think you mean the first season.  Leslie Knope was super retarded in the first season, I only struggled on due to the other characters. She becomes much better when they rewrite the majority of her character from season 2 onwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah and she was helpful too.  She has a comraderie + romance with another witcher at Kaer Morhen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't it the best thing?! It's one of the best ways she and I have bonded. We did the same thing for Witcher 3, to the point where I didn't really want to continue playing unless she was there to experience it with me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, she played a witch in *The Last Witch Hunter*, but I don't think it's fair to judge her on that just because her character was written terribly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And women in battle is just taking it too far 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This just keeps in line with the books. Geralt starts looking for Ciri in one book and doesn't find her for 2 more. Even Yennefer doesn't know what the witcher is doing and starts a quest on her own.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or if you plan really far ahead you can bring a ballista!!!!   In order to defeat the varmint you need to fall back, call in superior firepower, and that's all she wrote.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Limbo is a really great game. It has an art of story telling without any dialog which I find amazing, I can understand why she played it all day :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well... The games are superior IMHO. The first books have interesting stories, but the saga is kinda boring.

Plus, Yennefer is just as unbearable in the books as she is in the games. No wonder your witcher friends don't like her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Il spoil a major plot point for you, Geralt has sex with women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl has Monster Whoppers and that guy has a Monster Whopper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**Witcher 3 spoiler incoming**


The Wild Hunt was able to travel through dimensions, and Ciri as well, she even said she lived in a different dimension for quite some time. The Fallout dimension could exist and Geralt could travel there with Ciri 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
According to all the books story and plot lines and lore surrounding the game ciri by far out classes geralt by miles.. geralt has more experience and he is the star of the game so of course you're going to finish the game with him.. I can see ciri eventually having her own spin-off game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Could evolve into a Final Fantasy Tactics style game if she isn't careful 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That girl has got quite a thirst for that monster's D.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I haven't been playing from the very beginning, so I must have missed that stage in her development 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let her watch the Bloody Baron questline from the Witcher 3.
 
She will reconsider. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't there a Saber Bride in UFOTable's Unlimited Blade Works? When Gigamesh kidnapped her?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would like to see what happens when she finally finishes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I also vote Triss ,she is amazing in the games and i went with her .I know Yenn is his first love from books and all,but in games Triss is so much better
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly. I guess you can use the Arkham Knight season pass as an example of this. A lot of the content included is DLC I can do without. I'm only really interested in the Catwoman DLC and the Batgirl DLC but if they're anything like the ridiculously short and uninspired Harley Quinn DLC, I can do without that as well. I loved being able to finally play as Harley Quinn, but that DLC was just insulting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol I made sure to romance all 3 too. Cait was especially nice to help given her tragic backstory. I couldn't bring myself to do that with Preston, he's kind of weird.

____________________ TOPIC 28 ______________________________

That's why I hog tie her and take her with me every time I see this happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dastardly- red dead redemption- tie up a woman and witness her death by train
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Idk man bring a girl there and see how that goes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even after Tresspasser, I still didn't like her. Different strokes I guess.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oo I bet she would like the south park stick of truth game after playing the walking dead one. Good suggestion!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a pixar movie of a little girl who thinks everyone loves her in *that* way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Max can apparently look really mean when she wants to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Woo, good thing this ends right before she decapitates the giant and it spews blood everywhere.  And that's when the second stage brings the tentacle monster.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I put it in the middle of the road. Great place for her to chill during a radstorm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You could start her off with the walking dead and game of thrones telltale games
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you'll be playing with her get Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. Very good Co-Op game, very poor singleplayer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking it was a nod to those [brave women fighting against the IS]( for her loved ones and her homeland in the Middle East.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Absolutely every other women walking around in a renaissance fair. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
American woman, don't tread on me. American woman! Just let me beeee.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I'm not really into black girls either. Different strokes for different folks
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If she doesn't play much games but likes horror films, check out The Walking Dead games made by Telltale Games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would the fire foam have killed her by itself as well? She coulda been dead by the time they ran over her...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet she's in trouble if she has to poop
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did they really not check her pulse? Or did they check and thought they couldn't find one? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i used to (and sometimes still do) go to the movies alone in the middle of the day a lot, it just pissed me off that she seemed to think she was better than whoever was there that day, but maybe I was looking for a reason to be mad at her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess you get that a lot from the ladies

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At which point she had [insert your username]

Edit: I'm a an idiot 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i like what I see. They should make a movie about a naked woman fighting monsters. I would watch it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And where's the girl that has the middle piece painted?

\#plsdontkillme
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like she crossed the uncanny valley the other way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, catgirls, sisters, and aliens can refuse. Cripples can't ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just say it's to hire ladyboy prostitutes, might be less embarrassing 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He should try looking in the last place he saw her
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
IIRC she was somewhere in the southern barrens near where RFD and RFK were. In some dead village where there were mad kodos. I haven't played in years though so idk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes I like to put on women's panties and walk around 5th street.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The [music]( at the beggining of the game that played while she walks down the hallway, that scene was soo good for setting the atmosphere
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For honor! If you can't come in her, come honor. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let me guess, you're just shouting 'git gud, casul' every time she screws up?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean the triangles going out of her chest? 

Yeahh little me was REAAAAAAAL happy with that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess they don't have girlfriends for the queen pieces. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe that turned her into a world famous supermodel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you think that she's a robot in the first place!?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was flashing people in the park until I crossed three nuns.

The first had a stroke when she saw me, and the second one as well. The third couldn't reach.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes I like to walk around 5th Street in women's panties 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why do you think people bring girls to watch horror movie? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, are there cookies at the center of the galaxy? Good looking female aliens at least?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
["You see this? This the queen. She smart, she fierce. She move any way she want, as far as she want. And she is the go-get-shit-done piece."](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah.  He got the girl back, they had a fight, there's robot space monsters now and the zombies are gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet that would be an interesting sight watching her dart all around like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well here's an example, I think it was a different scene which she walked in on but they didn't shy away from bikinis:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So maybe she walks or jogs it off instead ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She's talking about the saviors from the Walking dead, she's going to kill everyone last one of them
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would glady pay you if you could do one on Alien Soldier where you fight Xi-Tiger on top of the train.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just me or the girl in the middle looks a little bit like Jamie?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That character is half orc though so it makes sense, this is what the full orc female looks like in the movie

____________________ TOPIC 29 ______________________________

Sometimes the best actor looks nothing like he/ she is supposed to look.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wtf was with that guy assaulting some girl with a shovel?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think the word you're looking for is heteronormativity.

Because obviously he can't cheat on her with another dude.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Eh, maybe maybe not. Haven't read anything about her on here
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh. I guess I don't think she looks anything like Taylor Swift.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;Jesus she's so ugly!

Let [this]( gif explain it for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I need to talk to my wife

I can hear her now 

"Hey!, Listen!!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looking a *lot* more like Ashley Johnson (her voice and mo-cap actor)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is that voice different? It doesn't sound like the deadpan woman I'm used to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the female voice actor sounds sarcastic when she says that 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Needs more Bastion. Bastion is best girl. Look at dem angles. Ummph.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;I call on the politicians to do something once and for all!

I presume she wants the politicians to keep stupid people off of television?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The tone she says it in is like she's absolutely reluctant to do it and whining at you, which is weird for her. You're not missing out on that :v
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I made it 6 seconds before her hair and voice annoyed me too much to continue.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see what you're saying, but games do it all the time. Ubisoft tried to use that excuse and people got mad (women are too hard to animate).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've heard a few women, like yourself, explain that they feel the same way. 


I wish more women would get angry and speak up. Men saying something won't change anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I first commented,  I immediately heard her say that in my head haha 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Or maybe not, it's hard to hear her when her mouth is full"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the girl talking at the beginning, i think i know where i've heard her before....[here]( the trailer here doesn't have as much of her voice as the opening...but i'm pretty sure those are the same people
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You need to relax and stop being offended by a hilarious representation of a woman. I'd laugh if it was a guy and btw they're going to make ones with guys too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This one definitely sounds too much like real life. One day she moved in and then she just never moved out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean if you haven't had the chance to meet the actual best girl sure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wtf are you smoking.   Soviet cant have a girlfriend.  Literally unlovable.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you watch a game when you can play yourself? You're not going to watch you partner get fucked by someone else when so can do her/him yourself are you? Oh alright, some people might..

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nobody is excusing what she did. They're just explaining why it happened. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like her "aw, yeah" voice line. I don't know why.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can literally hear the girls drying up whenever I hear someone say "esports"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Quite possible. I went with woman sounded to make sense.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I read Bastion, I heard a lady's voice in my head:

*Play of the game...*

Get out of my head Blizzard!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey it's fanime! I go every year but I never saw her :/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is there not a video without the scumbags just as bad as he is laughing at a woman who is obviously in pain?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was really hoping the second line was going to be, "Now that loser moved in with her sister"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
From what I've read you can just use a shout and she'll let you in
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean chilling with Elon Musk in his mansion playing video games? Man, seems to me she's doing alright. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can still hear the lamentation of their women.  That is best in life.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think you've never seen Jill Valentine because that looks nothing like her. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not, hair isn't curled and you can't hear her "million different voices that still sound like Ashley Burch" voice
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The one you want to drown in a well, not only for her shitty attitude but because of her haircut?  Jesus.  I'm sorry man.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
my old neighbours were swingers I felt sorry for any woman that got him he was rather boring and a little crazy  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fusion had her talking, and she wasn't the not-Samus we saw in Other M
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh hell no. I never even bothered to do her arc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't fuck anything to do with her to be honest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who said Ever was a girl? Sounds like a dudes name to me. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Never heard of her. Watched about 12 seconds of the videos in the article. Glad she got ban. Not because of her body or how she was dressed. Just because she was annoying as hell.      

"Yeh boi! Yeh boi Yeh boi!"    

Please shut the fuck up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Omg are people still whining about this?? Jesus christ like did u think this game was be your girlfriend 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I came in here just to see if anyone else also found her voice to be very annoying as well. I know the weebs are all about it but to me it would give me a headache listening to this more than a few minutes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hideo Kojima is the Hideo Kojima of Hideo Kojima. Now she'll understand. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh she is every bit as much in person. If anything is different, you would expect a bubbly girl or something of the sort but she is very quiet &amp; humble.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My girlfriend is more of a, "you were supposed to turn back there"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nobody cares. For anyone with a little sense it's perfectly obvious that girls play games too. I'm laughing at her too.

____________________ TOPIC 30 ______________________________

Creepy teddy bear is from Five Nights at Freddies. My 14 almost 15-year-old sister is really into it and I got her a bunch of stuff from the game for Christmas this year. Never played it myself though so I don't actually know anything about it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember the first night I had F.E.A.R. and I tried to play it in the dark. First time I saw her, I turned it off and would only play it during the day with people around from then on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do I just get my wife an apology gift now or wait until she hasn't seen me for a month? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
She gave it to you, so she can sneak at you phone
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't know about that one. I stopped watching about the time she went to the bathroom. I can't look at anymore of this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Had a roommate pee herself once. She came inside doing the potty dance and saying how bad she had to go...then just whimpered "it's happening" and peed on the living room carpet. She had been out with friends but I don't think she was that drunk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My mom would always rent movies and video games on her way home from work on Fridays.... She brought this home for the SNES and my weekend was set, I don't remember ever finishing it though.

This game really was awesome, I still think about it every now and then and bring it up to my friends but no one else I know has played it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not the exact same but I have a similar story kind of. My friend Dayna when she started high school started seeing a boy and she really liked him. She went home to her mom to tell her that she was going to the movies with him that night on a date. Her mother freaked out and confessed she had a brother and that was him. They have the same dad. 

They say they never did anything together before finding out but I don't believe them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The last one went back to where she came from. Just a fyi. She does that all the time..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, just offer a price yourself in these situations. I remember once my dad asked a guy how a cap costed, guy said €10 and we walked away, mom went there later (she wasn't with him) offer €3 and got it.

Remember another situation where we were with other people, asked how much something costed, it was €4, we bought it, then someone else wanted it too, now it was €5, we walked away, asked how much it was later on, €4, we offered €3 and we got it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well it was from the one time I went mini golfing with my grandma and she didn't tell my dad so he then beat me with jumper cables. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this as lame as asking out a girl via text 15 years ago?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why would you want to bang our mom's sister.....at the *funeral* of her husband?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So she isn't a grandma who stitched all those Pokemon?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I gave a girl this necklace and she actually loves it and uses it, I would merry that crazy woman.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My daughter (2 months old) wouldn't go to sleep last night, so I just drove her around in the car hunting pokemon and pokestops for an hour last night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a female probably younger then you both. Do I qualify for a gaming set up? I'll call you brother if it helps.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After getting home from working a double, sent a text to my very recent ex of 3 years, not getting anything back (after waking up to a text telling me how sorry she was and that her heart was still in my hands,) really feeling down... this helped. A lot. Holidays are tough, especially with a recent breakup. Thank you OP. I hope you enjoyed yourself tonight. You definitely made mine a little better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Married to a fellow gamer.  Wehave a stepdaughter from his previous marriage.  We always game together and get in several hours a night.  Weekends we do not have stepdaughter we game all day and night if we have no plans.   If we have stepdaughter (13 yrs old)  we can get like 2-3 since she wants alone time to FaceTime friends.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;I play in bed at night, usually after my wife is asleep, so I have to keep the volume somewhat low.

You play right next to your wife in bed while she's sleeping with the volume on? I'm impressed... I wear headphones when I'm playing in the next room from the sleeping SO
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Tackle is the only way to go. My and my cousins would play tackle all the time especially at Christmas. One of our cousins just got married a few years back and her new husband wanted to play with us. We gave him a hematoma the size of a fist. He never played with us after that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Here's [Sanders only 4 years ago toeing the same line]( The only difference is he said it much more recently than she did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My grandmother called me the other day because she "lost the Googles"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he used harden, it failed, she was disappointed and threw him away
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I'd drink a mile of her piss just to see where it came from."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've been married 15 years, I've taught her not to get married.

(sorry dear, I'll have the lawn mowed before you wake up)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember one kid in my highschool full on tackled a guy beating his women in the street. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sims 2:

I made a large house of partnered adults.  One couple I had the guy cheat on the girlfriend off and on while she was at work with a neighbor.

After a few days of getting away with it the Girlfriend comes home from work early without warning, sprints into the house, straight up stairs, into the room and catches them fooling around.

Joked and high fived them back together after that, but it took a while.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Excuse me kind sir, my female friend got together with Chad and I felt quite peeved.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I lost it at "I accidentally locked in my maid when she came to clean up all the crap these hotdogs have been making. She started going crazy and took her clothes off."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember playing this growing up and none of us (me or my brother and sister) could beat it. The only person that could was my cousin, so everytime she babysat, we would beg her to play just so we could see how the game finished
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well she doesn't have to know where the dinner came from. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As did my sister. And she's some sort of crazy super genius. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I completely agree, as someone who has never really been loved, I have that empty void. Sometimes I just want to give someone a long hug to feel comforted and wanted, but unfortunately don't have anyone to give it to. Never really been too close with my sister or parents to give them a hug, never had a girlfriend or friend close enough to hug either, so it just really sucks. The real reason I want a girlfriend is so I can have someone to hold when I'm feeling down, or when life gets tough, knowing she'll be there for me, but oh well, guess that's not the life for me. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think she was like an officer, I haven't touched the game in like 5 months, so my memory is rusty. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, if you romanced her, or became her friend, she eventually does sorta mellow out.  But only around you, so yeah the crazy never really went away did it?  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe I know your sister. This girl looks a hell of a lot like a girl I know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like her to show me to my rented room, if you know what i mean.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was about 10 years old, I was spending the night at my cousin's house. We were up late watching cartoons, when his dad, who had been drinking heavily all day, walked out of his bedroom, to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator door, took everything out of the bottom drawer, pissed in it, then filled the drawer back with the food he took out, and went back to bed like nothing happened. My auntie, who worked the night shift at the time was not very pleased when she got home and we told her what happened. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some guy/girl is going to come home from college and have himself quite the freak-out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have to leave it like that.  Don't break her heart, asshole.  It was a gift of love!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's only like 12 dicks you need to suck 

My ex did that, except she didn't come home with FPSs. She came home with stds 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I went on one of my first dates with my ex girlfriend to Chilis... Now I'm sad.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Your living room decor looks like your grandmother recently moved out and left all her stuff behind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Five minutes later she hangs herself in the bathroom and the other girl gets emergency dentistry with fucking sciccors
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're the kind of person that if I told my grandmother died, would respond with that's what she said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This was me when I first got ff7. I remember my mom going on a trip for Christmas and I asked for a memory card since I spent all week playing it and couldn't save or turn the PlayStation off. I was so excited when she came back and I asked if she got the memory card and she said she forgot...I think that's what led me to be the miserable bitter adult I am today. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just don't forget to evacuate the room of all breakable objects. And your grandma, if she stays at home.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think her sister got her those necklaces for Christmas.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I remember when this game came out, my step dad, my mom and I would take turns playing and it was a blast. My mom had never played a video game before, and when I would get up for school, she would be playing the game when I would come downstairs.

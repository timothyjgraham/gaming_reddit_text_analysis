Is he, though? A good mercy can sustain someone through nearly anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably knock him on his ass at the very least. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They should've done a few takes to get him in full swing once his nerves were shook loose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is actually fairly commonplace for Sony, a shit deal, I feel for you man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That sucks man. Australia seems to always get the shit end of the deal. I feel for you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he was sucked up by a tornado, he wouldn't bother to type this. He must've been dictating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's being stupid. It's irritating and I sympathise. It's a very nerdy habit to have and his problem to fix 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a guy who goes to the Ralph's near my work and uses their WiFi for stuff on his desktop.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You're probably right : /. Sucks he has to deal with this then..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good guy [Yoshi P]( Says his team will fix FFXIV and look forward to it.  
Fixes (rewrites?) FUBAR game and makes it profitable.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A www *sniffles* you guys are such great brothers!! Kudos to you guys for kicking ass 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I really need that beat. Anybody know what it's called or did he make it himself?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how the alligator actually sucked the man backwards -while he was still on his feet- before actually biting into him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So you're saying he should just deal with the bug and not have any work arounds for it? I'm not seeing your point?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think he did anything strategically. It's a game and it was most likely a glitch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't bother, you can't even pet him until he's fully grown.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Help = Kill everyone, especially the big bad guy at the end.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget when you look beaten up and weak later on your guy climbs like he's beaten up and weak. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
pretty sure dayz has like one guy working on it, it was a pretty decent scam.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He probably also sleeps and feels pain.  Just because he does something doesn't mean it's taboo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Now go kick his ass and take the other one back.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean the cowards way out?!


I've done it a few times. But man do I try hard before doing it 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man I really need to revisit this game with my (now) upgraded desktop. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I could have forgiven Kellogg, though. Benny was just an ass. Kellogg was the husk of a broken man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know, man, I learned what's what after a few times.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
give the guy a break, he's suffering from severe brain trauma
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like I said man, an i7 would give you a rig that you wouldn't have to upgrade for a while. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not as crazy as the physics of that guy freaking out in the third chair.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you can't,  so he was either exploiting a bug or hacking.  


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like I said to another guy I would break my shit if this happened to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Except of course that he didn't say "beats", but rather "beat".
...stupid
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not an ass-man, but that's one ass I could get behind. And in. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like the part after that where he talks about actually using Navi's help.  Yeah, how old is that game and *finally* she actually is of use?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, it may be for the best that he retired from gaming having only played one of the best games ever made.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe if he had a running start and slid up the steps on his ass?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So Fucking hard to beat. The best character to beat him with is the badger looking guy next to the blue one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or he can play the games on a laptop like he wants to and you can give him game recommendations instead of making an ass of yourself 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Help = Kill everyone, especially the big bad guy at the end."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You have to learn to let go. 

Trust me, you have to learn to let. It. Go. 

Buddy of mine didn't,  and he's a merchant banker now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure I'd just man up and not act like a dumb cunt over a little pain
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Help = Kill everyone, especially the big bad guy at the end.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes! He'll be great until midgame then he will suffer!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, man, meth can do some crazy ass shit. Never go full meth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Will he be able to beat my Intel i7 though?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes.... he can't sleep on his problem because he can't sleep.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why do you give a fuck? Let this guy have his fun, it isn't harming anyone, except your delusionary ass it seems
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not at all. Who cares who he supports. 

Not doing something "for the lulz" would make him a grown up. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We know the end of it. We barely know anything about his time as an outlaw.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He did get his ass kicked by a vegan though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This grown-ass 38 year-old agrees.  He's energetic, positive, and plays games for fun.  Sure, he sucks at playing most them, but having fun is his first priority.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 2, '______________________________\n')
You guys already got sly 4. Us jak fans haven't got anything since that racing game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like you'll still get fucked less than the guys who backed Star Citizen - heeeyyYYOOOOO.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doctors were able to verify he came from her vagina. How can we verify where this came out of? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Game has been in Beta for a while. Maybe he was in the Beta?


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's more than 42 hours per week, every week, since the game came out 7 years ago... 

Either that includes *a lot* of idle time, or the guy has a serious addiction. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believe he meant how they release ruby and saphire, x and y, at the same time. Not how they release ruby and saphire and then later emerald. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know man. One of the people in my clan picked up dementia at end-game. It's not nearly as fun as it sounds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I know he didn't know this, but I'd been looking at that specific fabric online and wanting it for the past several months"

Oh he knew 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lost Vikings man, its all about the lost Vikings.

When will Blizzard revive that legend?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're his fan, you would have already got a Playstation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He was 39, so even older than I thought. quite far from being in his 20s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I still have the demo of this game on my PSP, man I played that demo a shitton. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oohh man, that takes me back. I used to do this exact thing all time when the game first came out. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[This guy is definitely the most I've seen.](

I don't know if he's actually playing, or just idling though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of Minecraft was added wasn't it? I thought he did the basic framework
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's thinking of the guy who did this for the first game a few months back.

This is brand new.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't that prerecorded?  Like, isn't he just watching a video while recording another video?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think there will be an eventuel commercial release or a so called Star Citizen 1.0

But Star Citizen is a MMO being designed for the long term on a huge scale. Chris says he hopes that they will still be releasing content for Star Citizen in 10 years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it was just proposed by Cloud Imperium Games, and Chris Roberts wasn't in the picture with his Wing Commander clout, I *highly* doubt it would have gotten this kind of traction.  Many are Wing Commander fans following his next move so they don't feel the developer is unproven. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hell yeah man. You get to play the ffxv demo yet
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We need this after Nothing to do as a man Sky
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You posted this exact shit 10 months ago. Cmon man, I even remember seeing it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man i could hear the noot noot. Haven't seen pingu in ages 😂
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, its Chris Roberts. He seems pretty cool. I never played his older games but following Star Citizen has made me view him positively. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only guy here that thought Star Wars: Obi Wan was the best Star Wars game I've played?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's the guy that posted this a few months ago?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, he may have just not touched that clay specifically in 20 years. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I haven't seen this guys videos in years! The first time watching them I was howling with laughter
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually met Zezima a very long time ago it is awesome to meet people today who know of his greatness. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good thing he did because I wouldn't have gotten the joke if he hadn't /s
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's he playing?  Looks like a FPS of some sort.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then why is league the same boring shit, just like when I quit 4 years ago ? Not all games change, even in 6 months. By the way, I'm not a dunkey fan, I've watched maybe 3 or 4 of his vids.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't even know what game this is anymore. FPS's man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would have loved to see how long he could have gone undetected. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Psst, this video was set up and recorded by DPiddy (the guy in the snorlax costume)... she was in on it. Put down your pitchforks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He posts on instagram, his last one was like a week ago.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Could've sworn I saw some guy do this a couple weeks ago. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hells Highway was he funniest WWII game I ever played. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I play on Xbone. I have a few guys I play with pretty regularly and we pick up randos from time to time. 8.5/10 times the community is great, just a bunch of people playing a game and having fun. Sometimes people are dicks though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you guys a fan of RTS games? If so my suggestion would be Starcraft 2.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where can you find this guy? Haven't seen him before. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's because he hadn't gotten a new console after all those years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, haven't played Helldivers in a bit. Really fun game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel you man I played the first couple months 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't come into the community until 09 but these people are ledgends and faze can thinkn there on top but these guys are the ones that really changed it all﻿
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If that was his first online fps game then you can imagine the thrill he got
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow his English is a lot better than it was a couple years ago
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What if the wing like things on his head became his actual wings on his back? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oddworld man, I haven't thought about that game in years. I want to play so badly now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, he had survived on zombie apocalypse already.

EDIT: *ONE* zombie apocalypse. 
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 3, '______________________________\n')
Looks like a controller without analog stick. If he was using a D-pad, would explain why he can only pivot horizontally most of the time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how the guy in the right corner was just snapping photos in his phone the entire time. At least that's what it looked like.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have that same case! Do you know what kind of paint he used to do that?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, I have never thought to try stacking propellers together.  I can't seem to get enough lift!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see he painted another player in there as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i think he is playing it smooth to get with the fine ladies

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I'll be picking up every one I see. I want to put my Lego Dimensions guys in them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What about his fine? Why did he get a fine?

I MUST KNOW WHY THIS MAN HAS A FINE!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You got it man. The game has a way to connect pieces so they can move without directly touching
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Picture CJ just standing there, listening to this entire lecture from a crayon doodle. What do you think he'd say?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like that he clearly doesn't fit into the fitting room.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's guy in the pic looks pretty close to the guy on the couch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Plus he would have been yelling at people about spacing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think that he's painting on a tile by the way he's able to wipe off all the paint from the bottom
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dull? These guys make paint drying look like a friggin carnival!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he was all zoomed in, so he was probably like what is that, zoom out, oh its a box, oh shit!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hank wouldn't say 'Dammit'. He's more of a 'dang-it' kind of guy.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why does he sit his monitor on an old oscilloscope? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Where was he and what was he doing when that picture was taken
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guess he was sitting too close to the tv then...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't, but I'd take 2 pieces of eighth if he made it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe he has it connected to his phone and is using it to talk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[Every time someone says "Legos" instead of "Lego", "Lego brick", "Lego piece, etc., a Minifigure loses his legs. #LegoNotLegos](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No instead he took a picture of his phone...with his phone
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can do that, but then you wouldn't be able to see his controller setup, gloves, etc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it was his TV he probably wouldnt make a post like this, yeah? You know, if all his games looked like this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Appears so, he's got a guest spot on a Disney TV show too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Those are his good ones. Theyre in a box, duh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hmm. Good question. I'm going to say I doubt it. If so I'd love to see vertical splitscreen so I can run it across two monitors for multi-monitor "splitscreen". One guy on the couch with a controller and my at my monitor with kbm.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In case you are interested in René Magritte, [here]( is another painting of his—one of my favorite paintings and one which you might recognize.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The 256-bit https connection this guy made his post through is probably illegal, then.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he said on TV that if you wanted to see what you looked like you had to see someone else, another player. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, another one! 

I gotta get playing these. Just need to find some floppy disks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always thought [she touching his massive bulge playing SF2](  They say it was just her own elbow, but *I* know better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
split screen were the shit man! me and my friends loved that!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
With good lighting, a haircut, and actually smiling he'd look exactly like the other pictures. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no, you see, the man Gravity's trying to keep you down, but you got a freind in Ladders, I mean Eyyy, he goes up! he goes down!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because I have a one monitor settup with a lot of desk space, he just sits next to the screen and watches.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is basically spore.  My 7 year old will love it... nah, he'll like spore better.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
not sure if it's because of the camera angle but in that picture she has he proportions of a Corgi.

she's a looker anyway, though....just saying
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TFW you go over to play at your buddies place and he's got the wavebirds set up with the big LCD screen
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just looking at the picture tells me he's probably there already
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bundled them together for my multi monitor setup. Might as well post it here.
Nice work man, keep it up!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But if you stand there, does the guy paint you?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thought he was getting two in a row. Still, very impressive!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He would be able to see a lot clearer if he had a screen cleaner.

Looks like some guy running around on a painted set in a pear costume.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have that exact Lego box! It's in my closet so I can give it to my son when he's old enough 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd be that guy who would attach a 25inch screen to one of these and it wouldn't be so portable. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know right? and from the angle of the pic he is staring at her ass!
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 4, '______________________________\n')
Good, because he's my son. He can't have 3 fathers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You just had to make the black guy a slave
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was my first thought tbh, a man can dream
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[The nature skin is because he was abandoned and nature grew over him.](

If you're a white or Muslim male you still have a chance as an adult

I like how they made the character look like Hamill would now if he were a career military man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How he screams in fear in that film has entered my vocabulary in its own way.

"AAAAYYYYYHHHHHHHH"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a wild guess, but he could just be... joking?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's not at all what he said. Thinking that something might be desensitizing someone to violence and thinking that something *causes* people to become violent are two very different things.

&gt; e: Spelling
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I grew up with a guy named Thomas who had a really bad stutter so your name made me chuckle a bit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then he said his name was MR BLACK GUY.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ha!  The fact that he's wildly loved by the KKK and White Supremacists (and retweets them repeatedly) is enough for me.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
With his last name being Reyes, I'm pretty sure he's supposed to be an American of Latino descent
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't give birth to a son so he can be a fucking quitter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that's what his father said.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's because they're not aloud to talk about the real reason he committed his crime....extremist Islam.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's been growing that since the day of his birth
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, adults playing this are Aspie man-children. Our culture has gone to shit. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Knows some people? His son, Barron, is a wiz on the computers, he's incredible folks. Really is.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He acts like he can keep doing it and just talk about changing. All he needs to do is quit talking about people.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's about time Mr. Socko got his own game. Bang bang!

&gt; ficulty.

This guy makes SuperHot look like child's play.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know he's living the dream, the Kardashians are probably living the dream too. I'm just saying it doesn't change the fact they're doing it by making nausea-inducing shows. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; M'aiq's father was also called M'aiq. As was M'aiq's father's father. At least, that is what his father said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was unaware that he was her father. Unless you mean that figuratively...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can't believe a father would knowingly do this to his son.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, it does look like he has quite a lot to spare. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A young lumberjack who has yet to find his true calling.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He said she started making in fathers day for him so he does have children. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ahh good ole florida man. you get some strange reptile pussy. You get that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have a strange feeling you wouldn't be saying this if we were [talking about this guy.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And good at jacking people off.

What? You guys wouldn't say it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unfortunately I do not have the pleasure of owning a Reebok tracksuit... a man can always dream though :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
of course he has to film it so he can Show it to lereddit.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, he probably doesn't make a living off of it alone. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if Trump were to become president he'd definitely have to have Crazy Train blaring though his acceptance speech
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Congrats on forcing your son to be you. Maybe when he grows up he can get surgery to look like you too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"As a parent looking for his child" means that the "his" relates to the father, i.e. the father's child. This doesn't assume any gender other than the father's.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Chicken Skin is Carribean ( jamaican, i believe) slang for Goosebumps so no, its most likely his culture
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mr Rogers would be very concerned about you right now. But he would still like you just the way you are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why should they? He's a racist crazy man. He should be made fun of at any and every opportunity. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He wants to emphasize the fact that he's not American 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You do have a point there, and the censoring/removal of some parts would really irk me. A man can dream though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even know he was supposed to be white. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why don't we ever talk about how racist blacks and Mexicans are? why is it only the white man? La Raza and the Black Panthers can march up and down the street chanting "kill all white people", and it's never discussed in the media? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would be great! Then I could make a reaction video to his reaction!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right.  He did think a judge was biased because he was racially Hispanic,  despite being born and raised here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My father used semicolons, his father used semicolons, and so did his father before him! Now it is your turn to take up the mantle of colonel colon!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a Japanese guy that was born in Japan. 
why would you assume I'm not Japanese?

His father was named Mary, and his father was named Mary, and his father was named Greg. RIP.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 5, '______________________________\n')
see right now i'm playing through the entire trilogy, and i'm starting ME-1 again, because i'm a glutton for punishment. Part of me wants to play the game through on easy just so i can get through the game and on to ME-2, and part of me is like 'don't be a pussy, man up and slog through the game." WAT DO I DO?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; It would be a lot less monotonous if there was more content to grindr with

Like dungeon finder but for male only parties of two?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh yes, I remember all of the super Mario 64 TAS where the guys would beat it in like 5 min.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes man you want to talk about a lot of content and the slooooowwe grind to level cap.......EverQuest. every few levels was a hell level, that took forever to grind experience for.

Tradeskills for painful as hell to Max out....leveling was fairly challenging...ans it was hard to kill almost anything fun without a group.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me too man. It was so much fun for so long. I had to quit though. I've considered picking up a new mmorpg, but they all feel the same or worse and the time sink hasn't felt worth it since end game raids up to BC in WoW.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't. I think he was one of the most difficult in the boss rushes.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he can be the very first one you fight, even tough I doubt he was this guy first boss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like /r/RoboHoboUnderscore said plus, once you unlock the painted world you can farm the slug guys there you can get easily 10k from them and its very easy, if you unlocked darkroot basin to get to the forest covenant you can farm the NCPs there. its a little harder but good pvp practice
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Try this one, he looks like he would be especially good at fighting games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you need to dedicate more time man.  i can't think of any games with a worthwhile story that doesn't require some effort to get into.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm gonna be WiiU guy: Splatoon, Super Smash Bros 4, Mario Kart 8 , Pikmin 3, Bayonetta 2, Xenoblade Chronicles X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know it's different, he plays on easy and hasn't beat it. I was telling him how. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair that guy is a total asswhole in that game, I'd be tempted to talk shit too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Super Mario, when he was a plumber in new York. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's my go to guy in Mario 2 and Mario kart...

Shigeru Miyamoto is 64

Super Mario 64

SM64

^^^It ^^^was ^^^his ^^^plan ^^^all ^^^along...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is supposed to be some random warrior/soldiers horse. Jiub was the guy that wanted you to find his memoirs. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Diablo 3.  It's a game where you guys can dungeon fight together and even compliment eachother as you fight to kill bosses.  

... fml i need a girlfriend to do this with.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Persona 4 golden is one of my favorite games of all time. Highly highly recommend. I'm not a big JRPG guy either
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The boss fight with the machete guy in the stadium was so much better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who... also has a nightmare mindworld where he is fighting Rowdy Roddy Piper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Got me through windwaker! Some guy typed a hell of a guide for that game back in the day. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well his last name is Mario. They're the MARIO BROTHERS. That means their names are Mario Mario and Luigi Mario. So yes, he is your favorite Mario character.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I find Toad incredibly hard to maneuver in Mario 2 with his shitty jump stat. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To me it's worth keeping for Xenoblade X, Mario Kart, and a few others. But I totally get it. Do what you want, man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because what he wants is 3 more(not in conversation) low level skill checks for an unmarked puzzle with an underwhelming reward?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, the guy who posted the video /u/Rockstar42 posted is named "Destiny". He's not talking about the game called Destiny.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just loved playing as snoop dogg in his low-low
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, the guy is overall a boon to the community. He's been very interactive with the community and it's been great to have someone to talk to.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The only reason this guy is memorable to me is because of Magnum PI.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man you totally got me, dang. Your level of perception is astounding.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This was his 3rd time going to the boss, at that point you don't want to take your time. You just want to fight the boss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah dude sitting outside sm for 6 hours to get a group then have one tank rage quit was awesome man. Sure was hardcore! 

Wow wasn't hard core. Older mmos it cloned was hard core. The mechanics have never changed. Login do your raid weekly. Get geared go on to next fight. It's always been like that. The only thing that was hardcore was the amount of grinding they put you through. 

Pointless pointless grinding. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Since we're here, could you guys recommend me an MMO that is not dead and is not WoW ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know man, once you get the community unlocks and get the desert and the greenhouse it really opens way up. I'm almost to my 3rd year and going strong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can also play as his final boar form in boss challenge mode.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should go back sometime man, it's a really cool area to explore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Bomberman 64

Lava level robot boss thing.

Fuck that guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was also one big guy in front of the executioner's chariot boss in that area.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well the guy that made the mode thinks of himself a bit too highly, but looks interesting to try, but not to play.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was one of the earliest gen 10s, and you guys don't even have to get all the goosers. The reward for those that did it before the change was pretty useless. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
running through no man's wharf is harder than that boss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The day that I find a natural platinum blonde that likes me back I'll be a content man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was a guy reaching level 100 as a panada that didnt choice side. he was neither horde or alliance. meaning he was still on the first area zone.

he leveled by picking flowers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, he was the best for farming top items imo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand he is easily countered. I just see him as a character used only because of a lack of skill. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he plays them all at the same time, massive grind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He was big, that is why he was called Super Mario.  When he is little, he is just Mario, like in [Mario Brothers](  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You dropped th... oh wow, did he actually get it right on the first try??
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depends what difficulty you're playing. Sometimes he dies a lot.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 6, '______________________________\n')
&gt; doesn't have that great of HP.

you serious? he has more HP than any non tank character and can self heal. and he has armor
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How did that guy in the front survive the explosion lolololol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It got better, as long as you roll. But I've had areas where he just refuses to roll at the right time, like not jumping far enough off a cliff
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When he charges his buff to enter phase two, charge attack his back and visceral him. That way he doesn't do extra damage. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I beat him by doing some combination of backflip and attack. I can't remember the exact combo now, but if you time it right your attack lands before his every time. 

Such an iconic fight.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he was in front of the spawn point or a teleporter, yes they can.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's also pretty easy to poise break. If you get a faster swinging weapon you can usually hit him during the very start of his animations, and keep hitting him until you're almost out of stamina then roll away. Rinse and repeat. Not sure if you can poke him down with a lance, but that might work.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just played through this encounter again last night, holy shit.
I always do this encounter the same way.

Lancer-Monk with Counter

Keep your distance, and stay near the entrance. Use Jump to avoid his attacks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's using a hit reg weapon. If you aim where they are going then you won't hit anything since bullets register immediately. His problem was that his crosshair wasn't even close to the third guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It blinks because the guy just spawned and has a period of invincibility. When it stops blinking he's able to take damage

Edit: invincibility
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Er, spamming Q puts spotting on cooldown now, and spotting is the tamest it's been since the mechanic was introduced. Whatever man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've found a way to deal with that: when youre getting invaded, equip a greatsword in you secondary slot. They invade, start chinking away your health, you roll back and switch. Since neither of you can tell what the other's doing, he won't see that you have a greatsword equipped until he gets bashed in the face with it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I used Visceral attacks on him for the first 2/3s of the fight when he switched to two handed attacks since those were easy to counter. Then when he stopped using the two handed attacks I used the ranged attacks with the Beast Cutter (DLC weapon) to finish him off.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There was an annoying dragon standing behind me, he may have hit me. Or that's just the weather. Not sure. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The hack modules are a completely random add-on that doesn't provide a whole lot of benefits (aside from boosting dat sweet XP, dude). The spawns are set up so that you aren't spawncamped, but then you're so far away from the battles that you burn up half of the hack module just strolling there. And it takes too long to kill a guy so you end up getting two or three kills maximum before the hack module expires (or you die, whichever comes first).

The hack modules are just completely unnecessary.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Height, plus distance. His hook isn't terribly long-range, just more than his main weapon. Don't get close enough to get hooked, especially when you have a rocket launcher with no max distance.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The problem I had with him is that he could be firing 90 degrees in a different direction, I would peek him, shoot a few bullets, and he turns and instakills me. Or I hide again in time and now he is ready to kill me once I move again. In turret mode, he needs to be squishier or have spinup time or a huge penalty to rotation time. Turrets are for holding a single lane or two that are close together. The ability to swing around and hold every lane is bullshit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
On pc its called aimbot and you can clearly see his aim jump right as he goes to pull the trigger.

Phoenix: A fire specialist with a specialization in distraction and DoT. 500 HP, Tank.

Weapon: Flamethrower. A powerful jet of flames which deals low damage right away, but leaves a strong DoT which deals the bulk of its high damage potential over time. 

Ability 1: Firestrike. Phoenix engulfs himself in flames, and launches himself forward. Deals slight damage and stuns enemies nearby for a few seconds. 

Ability 2: Flameshield. Phoenix channels fire into a pulse which transfers outwards of him. Enemy attacks which hit the shield are blocked, and any enemy hit by the shield takes mild damage. 

Ultimate: Reincarnate. When Phoenix dies, he can resurrect himself to continue the fight. During/shortly after reincarnating, Phoenix is immune to all damage. This Ultimate can only be used when Phoenix himself is dead. 

Passive: Turn up the Heat. Phoenix deals more damage the lower his health is. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My favorite part is that he got hit — got up — moved a little not to be hit again — continued meditating.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
its a common rocket jumping spot/glitch spot (since he's a sniper), however it takes a while to get right so its kind of a waste of time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is an equipment item available to the scout class. When an enemy shoots the decoy head, it spots the enemy player that shot it. Thats how he was able to quickly locate and kill the enemy scout.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He always dodges the first punch, but, sometimes, he dodges it in a way that leaves him open for the second punch to hit him. That's how you beat it him without changing the port. 

You could also sometimes (rarely) hit him with a SOCOM or FAMAS, but only if you fire blindly. 

And, even though the CODEC will annoy you for the rest of the fight, at no point the 'I got it! Switch the control port!' call is mandatory. If you stubbornly ignore it, you could end the fight without knowing about switching. You'd also have to ignore the hint he gives when dying "So... you used the other... "
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow he used a projectile dodge move when the enemy threw a projectile from long range.

Incredible
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can wall widow maker, you can ice block a roadhog hook faster than he can hook and shoot, mei can iceblock flashbang unless the first hit is a headshot. She cab iceblock a charging reinhart. 

The issue with mei is if she's good and doesn't get flanked, she has two amazing short cool downs she cab rotate defensively and counter play everything but a genji. A good mei will never ever die 1v1 and can easily fallback from any out number. 

Her defensive capabilities and counterplay options are easily the best in the game. Which naturally isn't a bad thing, but put that ontop of her 175 damage ranged projectile, a instawin close range kit, a self heal and a high health pool is ridiculous. 

Either decrease ranged damage, increase block cool down or remove the heal.

"Just going to do a quick little fly by past these guy....... WHAT THE FUCK!?!? COME ON, THATS BULLSHIT!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Focus more on the booty and less on the man's health
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Three seconds in he hits he wall head first, teleports back a foot, then goes up and grabs the wall 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
wait that's how it ends usually I die before he finishes saying High
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then put TorbKea in the support catagory because he gives armor too, since that is the only thing Symmetra does that is supportive, shes literally torb with more turrets and different weapon.  

Both are focused around Turrets / armor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually didn't have too much of a problem with Lothric. With that fight I just learned how to dodge teleport attacks and then that one big ranged attack. The 2nd phase took a bit longer in remembering to dodge twice for the ranged attack, but that was about it. I got him only when I was patient enough to not wail on him when he's rezzing his fallen bro.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ignorance and frigging Gandhi.  Fuck that guy and his love of diplomacy through extortion and preemptive nuclear attacks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I don't think there was really an effective strategy other than either run through and don't die while looting (There was one of those werewolf guys who will just one shot you with your now non existant health. Bleed you if you shield too much.) Or you slowly pull them a couple at a time (which takes forever. There are so many)

[The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why did you linger without hitting the Options button before he appeared?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell man, whenever I try to flip or whatever mid air, it goes slow as fuck an is impossible but everyone else spins like a top if they want to. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
slow-motion rocket jumping always makes me think "man, physics is bullshit"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't forget he can stun, fan the hammer, roll dodge to instant reload, turn around and fan the hammer again.  He can even take tanks out with that combo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Summon Solaire, he's a meat shield for phase 1 and then you'll have enough estus for phase 2, also fully kindle the bonfire inside anor londo. If you don't want to summon then using a high stability great shield like the eagle shield helps.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whenever I use his right click, every single shot misses, I'm probably doing something wrong.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
McCree does 70 per shot, so it has a large effect on how long he takes to kill someone with a shield. Most other characters do damage more consistently in smaller increments so it also has the large effect. The sheilds are fine in medium to long range poke wars, but fail at giving very good protection up close from close range high damage characters like Reaper and Roadhog.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's why I'd always give my rocket launcher to a friendly NPC. Unlimited ammo and probably hit more guys then I ever would.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man I tried to love Brink the fast paced combat and parcore was great. But it just didnt have enough maps and game modes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would make his weapon more balanced if, like Dva, his movement speed would slow the higher his damage reaches. And that Ability 1 is kinda like Dva's fly but more op lol. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The reason it doesnt aim to kill the target its because the game doesn't let you. You are supposed to tackle him, you can't kill him. Not the defending the game since its still really bad how far he jump to the next target, but thats why of anybody is wondering.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Note how while he's flipping the plane over, he puts the landing gear up. Knowing fine well that seconds later he would be so close to the ground that his gear would have collided with the ground and flipped him over..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, what annoys me so much about Hanzo is his fucking E. Just aim in the general direction of something and pray to RNGesus. And most of the time it works.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I pressed the X button to close this 3 times.  I am not a smart man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've done that before too, ususally because I thought I put enough bullets down and then FUCK, I swap targets and the first guy turns around like **u wot m8**
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You say that like the attacks aqualung, supernova, bolt, Matra magic, and poison don't kill them. Sephiroth is just as focused on killing you in the end as he was with her, if anything more focused.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 7, '______________________________\n')
But he was.  Nationality is more than just your birthplace (even so Corsica was essentially French at the time)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I never understood this sort of thing. Any time I tried it, my character just flies off his bike.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But this some guy is doing it so it's totally news!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are they also the ones in charge of placing potholes on my street? If so fuck those guys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dunno if i understod it, but i guess he was saying that there is a 100% chance that it could happen.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dunno if I'd believe him, he can't substantiate his claims…
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least in my country it's legalish to have car painted like police car, but it can't have stickers that could identify it as police. In [this Finnish news](  police officer says car painted like police car, and says "criminal" on the side is legal. Although he mentions that paint job itself is partly unallowed 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Me when it got to math: *what the hell is he on about*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck. You might be right, apparently the guys who are claiming it might just be trolls.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I have played both games and nope, totally different man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't he more an undercover cop rather than a crooked cop?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
can't believe he dodged that police car. i would be splattered all over the font of that windshield. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah if you steered with the wheel on a bike you would crash yourself face first. Seen a buddy do it when he first tried to ride a dirt bike.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he still only has a spindle drive.....

Which is still a spindle drive....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And here we got a  guy talking about physics in GTA
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why wouldn't he just drive his actual car at that point?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does he just call the police on you when you steal it or something?!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
better believe he was going to charge you 200g + mats for Crusader
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He never claimed that he claimed that he claimed that it did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I am not a lawyer, so yes of course he could.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah at the minimum in his situation. My personal minimum is not having a cat. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His job will be replaced with robots and he will return to the plumbing business.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't believe it either but that's because he's never in the office any ore.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Flagged NSFW because every office has that guy who watches everything on speaker
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The other day I was driving along and a truck rear ended a smaller car. The guy in the truck gets out and drags the guy out of his car beats him up, gets back in his truck and drives off. The must of had a beef from way back. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, but not the way he was supposed to as per his job description.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nope? Is this like a thing circumcised guys have happen?

Or were you just being sarastic...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Essentially he was supposed to find and kill me, and as you can see, he didn't do a very good job at it :p
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And I thought he was going to land on the back of that truck. :/
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Judging from his last few public appearances, apparently doing crack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe it was the right place at the right time for the guy behind the car.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is the other guy in the car stealing his car?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd talk to a lawyer if I were serious with it. We're all working class stiffs or neets here man we don't know shit

i havent been able to play it, what do you guys like about it or think could be better? 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And it's actually sort of relevant! Well done, good man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I *fucking love* that KITTY!!!  Someone send a letter to Bubbles, because he is in jail... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A lot of that is VAT tax that all you guys have. Obviously shipping too. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Totally his own fault. There was no point of unscoping.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe because he called GTA San Andreas "GTA III's San Andreas". He dun goofed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess he might have to start looking for a job 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That way he can get rid of all his intrusive thoughts about driving people off the road
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy who crashes into the bus bench on his bicycle on his way to that lure loses. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That his vehicle is unique and fun to drive against traffic with... Don't be that guy.

When Sirius black let Arthur weasley drive his flying bike

Never had an office job- now I know what you guys do all day!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah, up until August 18th, he was basically tweeting/re-tweeting every day.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least he'll be able to get a job at polygon. Unlike us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think his point was almost everything is falsely advertised.

The velvet of his cape is amazingly textured. Hell, the gloss of the marble floors, the furs, the frost, the lighting...

Why am I not surprised that a guy named Blacksmoke Billy has a series of trucker-centric videos 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For a little bit more he could have had a [Funco buggy](
[So cool](

Not the Enlightenment era yet man. Artistic prowess definitely enlightened though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
47 handled so well in absolution though. he wasn't clunky at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is pretty much the polar opposite of my experience. Usuall there is one guy who doesn't communicate. That new incursion is a total bitch though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, that soundtrack is still one of my all time favorites
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, this is awesome man. I'm happy he was able to experience the greatness of this series and can enjoy just as much as everyone else (:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I care actually. It's great that it always works out well for you, but honestly they fucked up and I for one am glad that he posted this so I know to not buy from them in the future. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Preach man, I totally agree.  What the hell is "hype" anyway?  It's people getting excited for a game.  It's not inherently a negative thing.  I don't get hyped for games anymore because I'm 30 and I've played it all at this point, but I was still excited for NMS and as far as I can tell they delivered on pretty much everything people were hyped for.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he's a fan of master chief but not halo because I don't see any reach anywhere 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well the guy mentioned Tom Clancy. If the game ever ever mentioned Tom Clancy in any of the promos or anything like that then everyone that will play it will have that complaint. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like he is trying to be Halo-alike. And I never played any newer Halo than first one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I absolutely adore Bill Gates, he's the man I've always looked up to, but now this just cements him as my favourite person of all time 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yeah guys who needs Elder Scrolls VI when we have ESO?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Soooo...it sucks?

Saying it sucks doesn't mean that I'm feeling bad for him or anything, he fucked up himself, he got no one else to blame.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That'd get just as annoying as the cod guy that always says UAV overhead
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Aw...no I feel terrible about myself and for these guys who were just trying to make a cool game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you don't mind sharing; what's his name? I've always been a big fan of ME's soundtrack especially ME1.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
5 was my favorite by far. I agree with the guy that said 6 sucks. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he is a HUGE fan not a little bitch fan
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was more of a European assault guy (also with a fucking amazing soundtrack) but I'm glad these games are still getting recognition for how amazing they are.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As someone who honestly has the exact same name as him, I love this guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are more picky than me my good man.  That is a definite would as is.  Of course I had thing for her for decades.  I am a sucker for redheads.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh don't get me wrong man, I am loving it. Most fun I have had in an online fps since... well the last decent Halo
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel bad for the dude. He didn't hype his game everyone else did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well duh, because anyone has the stuff to do what he does but no-one else does it as well as he does. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Enjoy the experience man, if you get a chance pick up Majora's Mask too!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Watch this whole series, he gets better every video [Septar jr. the ultimate amiibo](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought everyone loved him, I didn't know he has a rap for being annoying
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe had to go get online to bitch because he wanted to play OFFline
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, I though he played a pretty poor joker, glad it didn't have more of him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man this got me so hype for VR. I thought it was cool but this looks like exactly how I would play and like incredible fun.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
man, I really should just go back to 8.1 I really liked 8.1 even when everyone hated it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you think he would enjoy Animal Crossing: New Leaf? I know it doesn't come off as the most "manly" game around, but it has been a ton of fun for my siblings and I to play together.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is some weak shit list man. ProStreet was mediocre and those multiplayer games are all wack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually, at no point in the show does Jesse say "Science bitch!"

But so many people think he does.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly cisco is one of my fav characters buts he is so annoying... his hatred for Barry is a little too intense imo..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, and he has quite a big archive, with about 4 or so Rainbow Six works so far.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean, he was technically a "Spartan-I", But shit a Spartan-II Johnson would be terrifying.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he just wants to hate, i say let him hate!! no point in saying anything
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I take it you're a cool guy, but don't get too cocky — there's a LOT of cool guys out here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
aw man that's disappointing :( Still an amazing work, though!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A series of misfortunate circumstances. Glad to hear he's a cool guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't believe that you hate to be that guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or he thinks it was the last decent title which imo it was or mw2 was
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If anything it's that he looks like a man that really knows how to enjoy a few tacos.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is going to hate it because he probably hasn't played Destiny since October like the rest of us. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think he hates the series because he has a degree. He hates it because of its "cutscenyness" as described by him.

I've seen guys do that on my campus with Street Fighter.

that reminds me of Legolas climbing his horse on the Two Towers

Am I the only one who thinks the guy on the right looks a bit like an old jim sterling?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not necessarily... she could've just ran off and went through with it and he followed her.

Maybe she found out what they wanted to do to her or somethinf like that.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even Justin Wong calls this the greatest come back in ESports history... And he is the one that it is on!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm more curious to know what happens when he jumps off now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's funny because he's dead.

(What's the game? Is it literally Paul walker simulator? )
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But could he do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I forgot who it was exactly but he was a mma fighter in the UFC. So im going night night for sure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look if I ran a hot dog stand, and I saw a dude murder a bunch of people and he wanted a hot dog, he can have a damn hot dog.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But, since it still went through, I guess we can say "Sky" is no man's.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They were eating a wolf... I doubt that wolf was his friend.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
idk if you found it but it's as he's going up the stairs 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is exactly how I ran through all the games. Full renegade everything, except my character likes his crew.  Don't mess with a homicidal biotic's crew.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Everybody already knows about Stonemountain64. He was already posted here and he got a lot bigger. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagined him giggling like a schoolgirl as he ran.

It made me giggle like a schoolgirl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it wasn't for the erect Squirrel cock I would think he was dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
**EARTHWORM JIM!**  
*In the soil he did crawl.*  
**EARTHWORM JIM!**  
*A supersuit did fall.*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just had some snow fall down my boot outside. It wasn't hot, but it kinda felt hot because it was so cold. I know what all you guys are talking about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It looks like he is on the way out. I mean he literally ramped off a plane.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's better is when you know you lit the shit out of a guy but his buddy dinks you with a headshot, so you don't know how lit the guy was, even though you know he should be dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the guy in the plane was going to jump out and skydive onto the guy on the planes wing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it is no mans sky!! and now he is playing another one as well
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell was he playing to need to spam them so much on a gba?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Never *actively* tried

But he damn near did it anyway... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Let me know when he picks up Ninja Gaiden 1-3.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rofl reminds me of this guy I saw in Insurgency once

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least he passed peacefully. Idk when it's going to happen with my grandpa but no amount of prepping will ready me for the day it comes. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would look even better if you just ran past these guys
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That saw's so big he can probably fly with it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I assume you sniped him just as he was about to jump to safety.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can just imagine him thinking to himself as he sees a blur fly by, "What the hell was that??"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Toadette is my homegirl.

I feel like the only person who loves Toad in this post.  He's so damn obnoxious, he's hilarious.

These guys can't be serious, or maybe hackers are even more stupid than we thought?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What happened with the other guy? Are you trying to rip people off
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah man, Rune was the shit. So many Rune LAN parties have been had.

Red Dead Shed. It'll be about a guy who paints a Shed Red.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've played this game so many times that, as soon as I saw where the guy was standing, I knew exactly what would happen next.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Showed this to my friend, he said "new Red Dead first glimpse."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This just reminded me that no man's sky went through that whole lawsuit just to keep sky in the name. Lmao. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at how fresh his cammies are too. Fucking boot
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Already unzipped, gettin ready to give him a good slappin and then this...he is chinese.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When he looks at the stairs with the guy, that killed me xD
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 10, '______________________________\n')
In fairness the guy said their should be a game, not that he wished there was
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yoooooooooooo that game was the shit man. Wish they made another X game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Geez man! Give us a spook warning next time! I didn't have nearly enough calcium in my bones for that last panel.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
can i do this but without arguing

like have a good guy go ''i like puppies

then another goody goes ''yes, i also like puppies''


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The entirety of his momentum wouldn't have gone through his leg, though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know you're joking, but that's like saying guys don't put on ties except to look like gods
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you had both a transmitter and a receiver, you could suck your own dick.

Many guys would never bother going outside again.

I will forever lament that they changed his voice actor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ah if it isn't a herbivore man it's natural habitat. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can't you see his face? That is the face of someone who's about to fuck shit up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, I fucking loved that episode. Always Sunny is the kind of show I never would have thought I'd love, but god damn do I love it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So instead of being "Good Guy Todd" In your eyes he is just "Guy Todd" Fair enough
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because you would totally get the maximum sentence for his, riiight. Don't be stupid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
See? His hat comes right off!

This man is a fraud!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Should be just like a butterfly, punch people in the animus would be in his voice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This intensifies even more its eyes, after he says "the baby's sleeping".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How about that guy in the first panel with the freakishly short right arm?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does this guy have some sort of degenerative bone disease? 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I've never even played mega man but that thing is awesome. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ah yes, his disgusting patchy facial hair in full hd. beautiful 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Charmander looks like he is screaming "OH GOD THE FAJITAS ARE ON FIRE!!!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ya exactly ^ this guy fucks
He knows whats up 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Goddamn Sixta comin over here and screamin in his goddamn retardese"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That Zenyatta's a bitch. He can't even cross his legs and float. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I fucking love that guy's voice, and with the script he has to work with? God *damn*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but the #1 is so good he/she wouldn't go down like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love it when he punches him in the face with the bandages
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well you should just renounce him and his fucked up god since he speaks for god.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The metal gear solid 3 cover! It looks great man.

God dam there's some talented people in the world :] Kudos man.

*Crotchety old man voice*: Damn you millennials and all your memes!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he should really shave that pubic hair from his face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Would you like to video conference then? I'd love to to conclude this face-to-face. 

If you're actually right and you're genuinely perplexed, be man and say all that shit to my face.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Unless you're a rubber man. Then your bones are rubber too! ;D

James Harding? Ya but he's got a hell of a 3.

I love Tarantino's unfazed face as he naturally calls him that.

Not sure which Snake he went as but he's Solid Snake now
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but.. but.. Troy baker doesn't voice Liquid, he voices Ocelot in MGSV:TPP
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah he's one of the best actors out there, especially when he plays the antagonist.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought the guy was a huge dick in the video too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh my GOD, I can hear his voice speaking it. Well done!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy ends every sentence in a weird vocal fry noise.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They did something like this in Metal Gear Solid 2 with Metal Gear Ray. He'd bleed when hit and they explained that he used hydraulic "cells" to move around. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He doesn't suck because you can put goggles and a neckerchief on him and god *damn* that is awesome no matter what his defects might be.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was he face up or face down?

EDIT also was he floating or no?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If X gon give it to ya, he gon give it to ya.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if only he could get the fuck out of my way when i'm on a fire escape, GOD DAMN IT DOGMEAT  
more like DogBlockthedoorMeat

Look at this big baller with his fancy carrier pigeon.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 11, '______________________________\n')
I can't imagine why. But the real question is if he got it repaired ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I disagree. 
Also, he's not being ignorant. He's making a joke. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I'm up in Canada, so no ;)

I wasn't making a challenge, I was more like: "Eh Buddy, you know what you're gettin' into right? That Texas guy, eh, he's uh, one a' dem things that's uh 'every *thing* bigger in Texas', eh?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if only he was making some sort of minnesota vikings joke 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look at the upvotes he got

do you think he cares
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; The Beetlejuice coaster?

Uh oh, looks like someone didn't watch the video he was referring to...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The catalyst was his own life, he should Looper himself instead of Intstellering.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who?  No, seriously, Who?

Edit:Downvote me all you want, all I'm asking is who the hell he's talking about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it was that packed, how would he ever have time to get all that crap out and set up without being disturbed?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

You need to see someone man. What you are describing here is not a healthy way to live a life. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think it's probably an in-joke. Like "he's been seconded to work on half life" is a euphemism for getting the sack.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the guy continuing the joke gets downvotes, but the guy making an incest joke gets +6?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You guys joke but this is a real thing...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was under the impression that was real life. Jk but I did think he was at least the one playing the game. I consider this plagiarism. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And the ~~Holy Grail~~ Life of Brian joke of the guy complaining about how Jesus ruined his source of income by curing him of leprosy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Has he gone his whole life saying it that way?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is why I play sports in real life so when ref does take his time i get rest time

Definitely thought the last one was "Temple of AIDS." Either way pretty sweet man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Seriously, I assumed that was what he was pointing out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Honestly, I was screaming "Joel, no. Joel! JOEL! Joel, Don't do this! Come on Joel, You're better than this!" But he did it.

Let's all take a minute to appreciate the irony of the name of the guy asking the question.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Hey guy, you need to save the commonwealth!"

1. Yes
2. No (yes)
3. Yes (sarcastic)
4. Maybe later (yes)

I wasn't the guy who said all that but okay...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
naw man I can do 720 noscopes all day in real life way more endurance actually running around than moving your wrists.

That's why nobody cares about his work. 8% of us do the same thing.

Yes I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury lane?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why is this guy being down-voted if his reference was real too?

"Is there other worlds" 
This guy asking the real questions lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Please refer to the thing i said to the other guy. Cheers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd like to believe he talks like that in real life, always.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be taken down by a needle. I guess he got his point across
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks man. I appreciate it. It will surely be a blessing alright!!! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then Evander had his game come out too didn't he? Real Deal boxing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus christ. The guy was probably half mast that whole time
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Holy fuck, man. This is so devastatingly true it hurts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think the video was even half over before he started asking for likes
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Exactly what is important in a man's life... his toys.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Jesus please don't let me end up like this guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a simple man. I see Fire Emblem, I upvote. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That totally made me like think about life though, man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guess he'll see how many real friends he has then :O

&gt; i was already 10+ hours into the game.

Oh man, that's nothing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohhhh, that makes alot of sense so even if i did say 20% ,20% ,10% and 50%. The guy who did 2 100%, 100% will get it?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I honestly don't think it's worth it, but I'm sure I'm he minority.

I just didn't think it was fun. I think there are better games.

I personally feel like I wasted $40.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


This guy had benchmarks between 7-28 seconds saved.

Seems about 15 seconds was around the average and it saved almost 50% of the time.

Saying only 10 seconds off a 60 second load time isn't accurate at all, it's way better than that.

Over time that adds up to an enormous amount of time saved.

Got through 1 minute of that cringe and had to get out.  Fuck man.

He said 25 games, if he would add those you listed too it would be more than 25.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good video man, great work. Very informative, been along time since i watched a whole 10 minute video.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do you need? A 10 minute compilation video and his resume?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For someone who's never done anything like his before it would take them way longer than just an hour.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I played the hell out of the multiplayer, man that was a great game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he's at least the second to document it. That's got to be worth something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean, he gets like 15 minutes of this a day at most.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like the part where he orgasms for 15 minutes straight.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
About 20 min each day working on it then :P That man must be really busy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you that naive? 

There's another one saying he's 17
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he keeps trying, he'll get that number up to 30 seconds like the best of us. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hate this game so much. I spent 25 minutes tying to get it. Though I still got closer than he's got in 25 years.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's his newly announced game. Silent Hills was canceled last year.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And massive PTSD from the hundreds of people he's killed 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Japanese? You mean one guy. 

And he spent 10 years trying, not 10 years on a single game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He sure looks like he plays Call Of Duty and rate it 10/10 each year.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who the hell have you been talking to? I don't know a single guy that gets $50 haircuts. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh I get it now. I thought he did it in 5 days and a total of 14 hours gametime. Like if he played 2.8 hours per day. Yeah, that sounds more like it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well he would be abour 60 in the second game i think
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In IT? You can easily get to the 6 figure mark after working in it for awhile. My dad makes over 100k and he works 40 hours a week and very rarely does OT as well. Think 3-4 times a year at most (for an hour or 2 at a time, so 8 hours of OT for the whole year at most).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What are you guys saying or selecting?  I have 11 or so hours and I was denied. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I assume the people who want the games remastered are talking about fixing the multiplayer, chances are they'll remaster the single player and be like 'that's what you wanted right guys?' 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Expansions man. Both are amazing and add total of like 40 more hours!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Depends on what he considers scary, there's parts where it might be pretty scary for a kid.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I got over 1400 hours on my CoD4. No other game i ever played comes close to that. Promod days were the best. But this is nothing compared to the guy who played 20k hours of runescape
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its not multiplayer. You will never see another player even if he's playing in a space right infront of you. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he was trying to say you could build a very suitable one for anything over $400 itself, not for $400 over $1600
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Guy above says he's at 1000 hours. I've also heard a lot about this game and I'm intrigued. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's not a talking space gorilla, he's a talking space scientist!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; I'm a 60 second man.

FTFY! ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know... Are you a vampire? Are you 2000 trying to get a 17 year old? Are you Edward or the werewolf guy? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Give me TNT and 20 good men and 5 years of work will be gone in 15 minutes. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meanwhile, the only Chinese man that has superpowers still comes from Qing dynasty, when China was conqured by savages...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You fail at comprehension, I never said i played 200 hours, the guy before me said he played 250.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not sure why you include over $700 of just amiibos in there man, don't you think that skews the numbers a bit?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy at 12:22 must have spilled his coffee on himself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that's for you. I'm with this guy, I have 70+ hours in it and none of them were unenjoyed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All you need to know is Norman Reedus and his best friend The Fetus, are on another one of their crazy escapades.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Over how many weeks? That's like 300-400 hours of work (if he actually DID the work)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That guy in the back just smirks like "Hah, that's number 12"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This games was the shit !! i played bout 24 hours and then  stoppped but man i loved it !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That game is rated M. I'm not one to judge, but he looks a tad bit away from 17 years old.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That would work great but man a bit scary for me to think about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe he means ~17 1/2 minutes a day or 7/24ths?

When I played Aladdin on SNES when I was a kid I would give my brother a controller and tell him he was playing as Abu so I could just play in peace. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Without Anakin Count Dooku would've likely taken his place. Windu confronted Palpatine because Anakin told him to.

Don't let them bring you down. Keep being that friendly guy. We need more kindness in the gaming world.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And if you marry her he follows her still, even into your house.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I remember, don't you then see the guy get mugged and killed if you gave him the credits?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My friend bought it and told me to get it too because he wanted someone to play with. Two days later I get a text from him. "Dude, don't get Brink. Just don't."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Remember kids, if he was a 6ft jacked chad, she would not have given a fuck that he was playing Pokemon Go
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My son JUST got one of these on Saturday as a Christmas gift from his great grandmother.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like he attended the Prometheus school of running away from things.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
More confusing... Why did they move back into his old house? They didn't move into her place? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, he is exactly 365 days younger than my mom.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Every time your Dad says he has to work late. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Walking/Longboarding. He's staying at college for the summer so all his friends are with him to play. They go out looking for Pokemon a lot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Digitally?  Ask his parents to PayPal you the amount of the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just the guy or is there a girl too? I don't even remember seeing a girl in the trailer
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish someone cared about me as much as a 'noooo' guy cares about suicide guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't he at the crater near the end of the game? I always felt bad like we were disturbing his home or something so he came to murder us.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When I was in high school my dad was a bartender in NYC. I would leave the house early in the morning to take the subway, and he would be getting home just then. We would see each other in passing and always say "mornin Sam" "mornin Ralph". Only good part of high school. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he was a sk8er boy she said see u l8ter boy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
[That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age.](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it says he brought it from somewhere so soxfan is just asking where he brought it from
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Happened to me earlier. Was convinced the guy was hacking, but after seeing this apparently he wasn't.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For me, I was the older brother and I'd ask for something and it would be in my presents....but have my brother's name on it too. So many deleted saves because it was also "his". 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I live in Iceland, Plague uses the european dating system for me, so he is right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wish we had more pics. It's in the middle of opening/closing too so it's not like the guy wasn't home.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, he lets elves live in their own district, but he makes the argonians live out on the docks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ask him if he is a boy or a girl.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't, this is reserved for younger brothers and I was the older cousin and always the guy with the games among friends so....

An elephant never forgets that God so loved the world he gave his only Son.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
reminded me of the oh no guy from family guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, you just brought back memories playing day of the tentacle
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so he lived near you but you met him in Amsterdam. Crazy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he went to the prometheus school for running from things
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Makes sense. Friend of mine went undiagnosed with schizophrenia because he was told he had tinnitus. He didn't, and when he went on medication for schizophrenia all of it went away. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Daisy is like the unenthusiatic friend that Peach begs to go on a date with her boyfriend's brother because "he really needs to find someone, I'm sure you two would really get along!"

Well, john did keep asking were he knew him from. Maybe they had met before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So we know where Steven Gerrard went now that he's retired
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He called an innocent, 62 year old man a pedophile. And then says that's a good thing because it gave the guy attention.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I see he also graduated from the Prometheus School of running away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a guy that went to high school, let me tell you dihydrogen monoxide is no joke
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so he retired two days earlier..than planned.... what's the fuss?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The scariest part of the whole game is when you look at a naked sketch your wife did of you, and you see a middle aged man's junk hanging out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ex battlefield exec.. he is just speculating. don't think he knows anything about BF5 and if he did i don't think he'd be allowed to spoil it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't the son still part of the murdered family? How can he marry someone?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As a guy that remembers playing Candyland back in 2nd grade, I came here to say just this.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd find that guy who gave me the most shit in middle school and mosh the shit out of them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man! Came here to post the name of the game myself. I played this when I was a kid and loved the hell out of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yes it did. he's just older than he was in 1993. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believe the kid may be thor. In Norse mythology he is redheaded.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's my brothers receipt. He didn't pick up the game, just his receipt to pick up the game release night.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 14, '______________________________\n')
You are quite clearly a man with a lot of patience. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You are purposely entering another players world with the intention of killing them possibly making them not embered, in the end your the 'bad guy'  here as an invader
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is a blind play through so he likely didn't consider it 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i think a blunt is literally considered a part of his body now

I have literally been repeating that thing every time these guys miss.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"I need to find the man who shot me in the head."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how it's so obviously intentional that he looks like that (hence his name) but it's gone straight over your head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awwww man I miss this. Now I want to bring out my old Genesis
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He still can't possession of his suppressor unless he has the ATF paperwork sorted out. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And tell me, what's he diffwrence between someone going on LFG.net to do a raid and someone matchmaking? Its the same exact fucking thing its just that it would be more simple and directly in the game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Van Nistelrooy's goal, right? Because that was hella legal. Ponucci fell out of the lines seconds before the goal,  he was definitely part of the play. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes they are comparable, at least on one criterion:

- mass effect is not a shit game.
- no man's sky is

there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean wouldn't your mii look like that if s/he got that score?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;  I always considered myself more of a Hershel man.

:)

&gt;no-headed Angel

:(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
because of probability

that guy will never have that happen to him again

it'll happen to me once, maybe, and then never again -- because the odds of this happening are so slim they're practically nil
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes I would, shit happens man. It wasn't as if they deliberately did this to fuck you, it was one mistake. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No he didn't actually start dying. He literally started dying. Like not really
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't get what's happening here.

Is he using some kind of spray?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
True but all the other guys miss out of the tremendous amount of lead one can put out!!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah Ik just a hypothesis. Clearly not the kind of guy that would think something like that through
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look, he was shot in the back.  He had no way of knowing who shot him.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagine the guy doesn't really know who was doing the spraying after the first.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There is a fine line between courage and foolishness. This guy clearly crossed it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well actually Sauron and Morgroth are two different entities but their intent is the same. However, beyond intent is motive...Why? Why would he want to do this?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, you said he was at a Padres baseball game, and then that he was at his own concert.

The guy's question was probably to clear that up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's a champion diddler, but he's ashamed hence the bag on his head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;gets shot and falls into a pool

Wasn't Gatsby already in the pool when he got shot in the book? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know that guy now has a Wiiu and emulating all his old games. So he kinda got everything back plus a new system..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Right at the top, kind of had to see but it's behind his head. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
so frustrating when you get everything you need then get shot and have to watch a guy teabag you as you bleed out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you suppose they would have done the same if she were old or a man? It's pretty clear their motivation. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't be surprised if he expects to play against *actual* pelicans.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because he just shot randomly...it wasn't a skilful shot or anythinv
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't be the only person here that knows this is fake.. Come on guys, you're better than this.

You know what wasn't fake? Harambe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The "You ready? You ready? Well brrring-it-on-kamon!" line is what still even after everything he's done, make him likeable
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
First, he said "so many", not "any". Second, that game was terrible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At what point did he say it wasn't fake rofl
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As I recall from the post he made he tried to talk to them already
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, I guess humour is a very droughty plant over here...

I don't even know this guy.

"Let's get to bashing butts,  as well as deeznuts"
Man,  I miss that guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
man do i miss TFC . DOD, and BF2. though bf2 outlasted them by far.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I always thought Scorpion's portrait shot made him look like he's surprised about something.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he said opponent not enemy.

he was still your opponent  quite a few times 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's the goalie and he almost let a ball go over his head and into the goal....

You know you're a positive guy when you think hell is a romantic place.

He's not a good ball player, he's not a bad ball player, he's THE ball player.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It could be that it's not actually related to the game and he got it before he shaved his head. It looks a little old.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just practicing his touch-and-go skills, no biggie. The casualties were convenient, that's true.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And he returns with a witty follow-up. I've clearly been bested by comedic genious.  
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 15, '______________________________\n')
Haha oh man you're salty. Hope your day gets better!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and im the guy that would follow that up by saying "eat shit moron"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now I know what's gonna happen to that guy though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Played it once. Never cared to play it again. Dont do it man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's weird. I'm not even trying to troll or anything but this guy just kind of lost it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait until you hear what he does in Roller Coaster Tycoon.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guess it's true... he who laughs last, laughs best. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I would not take that bet lol. Just trying to give the guy some hope
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh shit man, I'm no pro but I think you're trying to hard at trolling. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I dont see how he could have. I almost cried, so sad :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks man! Its what I like to tell myself too haha :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow man what can you do with all the karma?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man. I both envy and pity you. Just be thankful that Kebab and Baguette don't blob as much as they used to. Also, never trust the Burgers. Godspeed sir.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck, you guys both don't care the same amount, OK?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha really? Wow man, you're right, I'm totally the troll here.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah. That's not me. Thanks anyway man. Good people are hard to find. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lolololol exactly man, games now days don't do it for me they just dont
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That one genuinely disturbed me. I don't watch his videos anymore
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow. Why is that guy such a little bitch? Even NMS didnt start lawsuits 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
???

How is this a troll, again? Anywho, what he said at the bottom was true.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he doesn't seem to really care at all about her is the point, moron.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just heard Jerma985 laughing so hard he wheezes in my head.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That sucks. Do you get penalized in the game for team killing? I guess if he's a troll he doesn't really care.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For a guy who doesn't like reposts, you sure care about karma a whole lot
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I lol'd pretty fucking hard at Reaper being in there.
I guess he's there to put the game out of its misery?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok now you're just having fun jerking these guys around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just me, or does he sound drunk in this?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I bet the guy flipped out when this happened lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man this brings me back.  Thanks for the post.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As soon as I started the clip, I was thinking "I bet they didn't kill the other guy." haha
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ok just tried that it works now thanks man :)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I watched the whole thing. All I hear is what sounds like pac man screaming 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
take a few tips from SpaceEngine, "random shaders" got nothing on this guy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because he's just karma whore reposter who stole this post from someone else.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like how he is laughing so hard he can't gobble.  That video was a much need laugh.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thanks man. I was hoping there were a few more of these.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wonder if some guy has ever used this pun at the end of a circle jerk.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was my guess too. I was hoping they'd inset what he's seeing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gs/secs = jerk. Someone can take 8 Gs, but not if they're instantaneously jerking from 0 to 8. The way he said it may have sounded a bit clueless, but the dude is right.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Shit, man. I'm actually kind of jealous. I fucking love those stickers! You even got those holographic ones!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ouch man. That really, really sucks. Hope you get justice.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wouldn't you say I'm trying to get *his* karma? I would. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
# thanks man wew you liked the meme i like ur meme thanks man wew good meme im glad u liked my meme i like ur meme wew thanks man thanks a lot
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is gonna sound really morbid, but I really want to know what game he was playing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
im sorry to be that guy but its how could this happen to me
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ive waited so long for KH3 that even if it sucks I dont know if id care too much. I just need closure, man :(
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh, That darn deadpool! Always so crazy and sarcastic, you never know what he is gonna do!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I kind of wonder if he has the most recognizable "Hello" to me.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey man, breathe. It's gonna be all right. Everything is OK, it's not the end if the world. Better? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Damn, he dont even get some love from the hottie
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 16, '______________________________\n')
I'm pretty sure he's referring to the video of the actual ads posted above
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Explain please - what book, what author, who be do drizz man?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What kind of medium is that? What did he use to make this artwork?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, but let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Jarl Balgruuf doesn't know what he's doing. He knows EXACTLY what he's doing. Jarl Balgruuf is undertaking a systematic effort to change this city, to make Whiterun more like the rest of the world.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I misread what he wrote I suppose. I still like the poster though. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably because if you read the actual post he says that he already played and liked it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not a translation thing lol. Even in the article he mentioned the point of using the word stranding. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Who's the bigger fool; the fool or the fool who has words like "libtard" in his vocabulary?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He didn't actually say that it was just his team so there is some ambiguity there.

Not to mention if your interpretation is literally true then they won't even begin working on Elderscrolls 6 for 6 or 7 years.  Might be 2024 before it even comes out.  That reality seems a bit unrealistic.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not really an apology just more trying to understand his complaint and if it had any validity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah seriously, who does that guy think he is? Some kind of Twilight Princess?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yea, I guess. 

Can't get into their reviews for some reason.

Not a big fan of Yahtzee either. He's funny but I don't see his videos as reviews at all.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Same here, I've been a fan of their channel for a while and never knew this. He otherwise seems like such a fun loving logical person. I don't know when the Scientology video was made but maybe he has come to his senses since.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The music is so beautiful. Btw the music is also done by the same guy who did the music for the original game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His parkour is probably good because of those hover shoes he is apparently wearing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know he made an another comic after the April Fools?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure that he just meant he agreed with him
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's a piece of shrapnel! I'm not too familiar with the history but I believe he gets it in MGS Ground Zeroes

I thought he was a Nazi.

The more you know.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes he you do, but in the movie he was created by Scientists
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He actually has a remote with some of Claptraps lines, and I know he has used that one a few times at stairs...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Thought he was supposed to be Scottish?  Or am i confusing the two accents?

Guess what? He can't draw it however he likes, he'll draw it how the art director likes, and the art director has decided he doesn't like the butt pose.

I was the one that said "Please explain". I wanted to know what his evidence was.

I respect a man who is true to his word.

I don't think he meant to. It just sort of, Plopped out.

I don't post but after doing some research on this idiot based on yesterday's attention I found this video he made just solidifying  that this is the type of person he is and that Tony is just an example of those he tries to victimize.

No worries, I can understand the frustration. 

Yeah you're definitely right about that! I think reading about war is important because it really shows the true nature of man and nations/empires. If you have any good books to recommend or info about the Balkan front I would be interested to read it.

This is the most true thing about bad guys I've read.

I thought they were comical (if you were talking about his clown-like cries)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are all his comics this much of a fucking buzzkill or did you just pick a bad one?

Oh man... Stupid people really don't have any idea that they're stupid.

Gus Sorola never ceases to surprise me with his creativity
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Great analogy. 

One reason he was a bit popular is because he had his own comic book or novel? I don't remember. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he meant the text for every shrapnel and things like that, not the actual dialog.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know GRRM has achieved something when he writes a book series that kills more people than the Bible. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I believe the artist he was referring to actually did do some art for the game, but the one I listed created the official box art.

Pewdiepie doesn't even do reviews ... he just plays the games while making jokes.

But... this is exactly what he said!

He literally said the definition in better understandable words, so did I, I see 0 differences between our definitions and the one you quoted.

No, I reinforced it with the new evidence, to call the guy delusional.

Don't people normally get mad when a movie strays from he books? There's just no pleasing you book types

Am I the only one confused by the name of his new game? Death Stranding? I've just never heard the word stranding used before. Stranded, but never stranding.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Am I the only one that is confused by the (he didn't knew) part? What does that mean...

Not every single npc needs to be interactable. Could have some random inconsequential guys wandering around that just say "hey".

He is telling him that the reason he is dying a lot is because he can't play

I think the guy that sent him on the mission wanted ww3. I can't remember exactly but he had some reason he wanted to war with the Russians. I'm pretty sure the general ended up being the final boss you chase on a boat at the end of the game.

That's a great point. So if it's variable whether he goes or not he could very well be alive. But once he's there, if baptism becomes evil constantly, not as a variable, than by killing himself he kills all evils.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He fought valiantly, he fought nobly, he fought honorably. And he died.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's not exactly secret as you don't have to seek him out, instead he seeks you out.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
it's not like the tree sacrificed himself to help Link, he was going to die anyway. Everything that died due to evil died for "nothing."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What are you talking about? I've had over a dozen fights where I was fighting something with its helper friend 

I left the the area and pounded out fights with litten until he evolved but those mudbray earthquake attacks still really hurt because fire is weak against earth 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck, I just want to find a group to play with and this guy is literally building his game world. -.-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To his point, you can END the game retaking your place as that evil person...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure without the player's intervention in Fallout 4, the Minutemen would die in Concord being massacred by raiders, the Railroad would eventually be found by the Institute and killed to a man, the Brotherhood would never find the Institute, and the Institute itself would eventually crumble due to being unable to acquire the beryllium they need for their new reactor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
New DLC for Monster Bash.  The monsters have taken your dog into the future and you have to team up with Commander Keen to rescue him from the evil Jazz Jackrabbit and his army of robots.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Too bad he is going to die in a prison fire
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you can backstab him during his power up to second stage, it will make it significantly easier.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But Walker was an actual interesting guy either way. He was a good seeming commander at first then he slowly just...unhinges.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I arrived on that beach as a starry-eyed boy... I left that beach as a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Literally you see he's a synth immediately after finding him. 
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 18, '______________________________\n')
Love how the guy at 0:39 is wearing a Hooli short
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'd imagine he probably does things like that on the regular
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Literally has the same colors as Frieza from DBZ. This looks to be his [third transformation](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely Balderich. If you look closely you can see the spikes of his mace. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the rabbit supposed to creep me out as much as he did?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just wanted a normal sized one but the man said it was risky 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And on top of it all, *he's wearing glasses*.

**Literally unplayable**
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this from Jericho's stream on twitch? I rememver watching this live on his stream...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohh man.. this would be so much fun with vr... Cockpit view.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No it isn't. Looks like he is wearing a huge diaper.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So I got 5 feet and 5 meters mixed up, apparently. Still though, he would have to be some sort of fucked up. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or just light a turd on fire if he wants the experience of the more rural parts of... well, everywhere.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't there a leak from the same guy who leaked the last few AC games saying the next one was Egypt? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If you're with Danske he will sometimes tell you that what you are wearing is not apropiate. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no worries, I didn't notice his name was similar until you said something
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not like the Horatio, since there's literally just this one guy, and it's not like the Republic of Dave, since there's literally just this one guy. Probably.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell is a snorlax and why is he shitting light beam bombs?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why are you assuming he acts, talks, and dress like a thug?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gotcha, I thought the little straps were windshield wipers at first. Made me think he had one big glass visor. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet, has a rubies deluxe suit instead of making his own and personalising it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
well, except for his peripheral vision.....

if he was wearing a VR helmet maybe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You know what they say about guys with big feet.



They got big socks mothafucka okaaaaaay.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's unlit though, I'm sure he's using the lighting from the game and then just adding some color correction and bloom in Photoshop.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also you'll come across his helmet up on a spike in Hell. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can tell its a new experience for him.  He is shaky and unsure of his movements.  After a while that will subside... probably...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is wearing a vr helmet.

He is in a green screen room to project what he is seeing in the vr headset to the viewers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And get it all over his beautiful shirt? No way, you dingaling! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was that Seth Green giving the t-shirt to iron man? And was the dude from Deadpool there too? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah; but that height is with the suit is it not? I've only seen "around 7 feet" for his height; no mention of that being with or without the suit though.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he's just playing the in-game character named Keith David.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I imagine we all think he's playing with bubbles or something but watch it again and imagine he's playing with a pair of really stretchy, slippery titties. Makes it so much more enjoyable. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What do I do when I find him and then find out he doesn't have the shirt anymore? Should I just take a shirt anyways?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
See, that guy should have been wearing the wrist strap. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is the guy wearing to suit from the Martian?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just needs the How to Basic guys grunts mixed in there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
isn't wailord so big and light that he would float?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Doesn't he wear a V-Neck normally though? It's not like she's wearing a tank showing all but her nips or whatever.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or the headphones combined with a modmic so he can use them like an actual headset.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like this guy and the Colby guy. Neck and neck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
not even close, Zelda wearing green clothes, and it's a guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This blanket is comprised of [560] 3 inch squares that are crocheted and then sewed together. Approximately 73,920 stitches (including the stitching to sew it together).

I'm a lucky man!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In superstar saga no one knows who he is

Bowser just calls him "green stache" or "green guy"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the aiming-downwards thing is actually him compensating for recoil (if you're really experienced, which I'm guessing he is, then you can calculate that beforehand)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"You'll do"

You think? I'm not sure, he's a bit green.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No way it's 150kg. Eddie hall is roughly 150 and he looks bigger than zangif. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
*He was so bright with a bright light he was brighter than the brightest thing in the galaxy he was so bright.*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he's wearing his special metal vest under his coat :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't call it "dressing up" if it's his uniform for work. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah its post-production, but he is using a VR headset. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I know right, a green camel. now if he could just find the tan and brown ones he could make camelflage.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 19, '______________________________\n')
So what happened here? Why was he able to turn around and leave without getting shot at by people waiting to gank him?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dreadog and no he wasn't the best or even close
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like your man bits are caught in a pokeball.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Probably wouldn't get a better deal from the guys on Pawn Stars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man this made me think back to the "trial of grasses" scene a bit later on....man the cringy guilt that gave me!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that game can be maddening man. The kind where you chuckle to yourself because you feel your sanity slowly slipping lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That was way longer than I expected. I thought it stopped after the first guy but it kept going!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I was that guy I would probably just turn off my system instantly and just walk away, I would feel like the game doesn't want me to play at that point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is when you walk next to him and "accidentally" spill your drink on his rig. 

Seriously, who the fuck does this? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
...and then once you guys get started, you never stop!  ;)


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The other guy standing around is like the referee. 

"Disqualified! You took too many steps."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
My guess is his improper use of "your" in place of "you're"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean, to be fair, Sonic only drinks because Amy is having an affair with Miles Prower. He has two tails, and he has two....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Good game! It's only because you guys past me I kept trying to go further too so good on you too man!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm 27 and have a bunch of grays. It happens fast man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Too bad he only got second. The scoreboard at the end for like half a second shows someone else already got first. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The way he pauses before just dropping back is so satisfying.

That said, if a fire marshall caught sight of that, they'dve lost their shit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This made me laugh more than it should. 

I like how the first guy just went on ahead, while the second was like, fuck it... *bang!*
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha he literally looks exactly the same as he does now ! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha he looks down and was like wait... what that wasn't for me oops and pretended like nothing happened.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i love the one on the left. he is quite suspicious. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fuck yeah I did! Been doing cookies in his parking lot all morning.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How old are you guys to have your bachelor party in a skate park?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The best part is that he turned at the last second to see it coming.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
daigo didn't win, he came second, this game was winners finals
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;no where near what they used to be. 

Figured I'd give the guy a hand so he doesn't have to constantly repeat himself. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was at this moment /u/Puffbrother knew, he fucked up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, I believe it's something like 7 steps and then you dodge roll to his right and he's dead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The dead guy was dead the whole time! Classic m night shamwow
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe that's because he's tired of this shit, looking for her only to realize she's in another castle. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pillowtalk went off the grid. He realized he is a billionaire. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
does he have to turn right 270degrees to turn left?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That moment he looks over at sledge before exploding. He was probably thinking "You Bastard!".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That used to be true, but then some other guy exercised for 11min, and it just took off from there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He didn't say he took *this* photo. Just that he took photos of her and that this one was taken by Martin Wong
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love the way he turns around to try to figure out where the arm came from. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's how good jerry is. 

why did you think they didn't want to let him play?  he wipes the floor with them every time.  hell he could have used a trackpad and still cleaned house.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He literally ran away from the obj after... he just went in for kills.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Looks like Hancock slipped a bit of his chems into your Nuka Cola when you weren't looking.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I killed this guy the second I ran past him
I feel baaad
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I loved the part where he paused for applause and literally one person clapped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
someone should invite him out for dinner, what's his name?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was thinking that during the second boss.... "what if he just... decides to sit down?" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The best part is that when he shows it off he pulls into the incoming lane lmfao
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Heh. Just noticed he has his ribbons on there as well.


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like to imagine the guy doesn't even realize what is happening behind him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Turn his clergy to vegetables" Geoff lost his shit on that. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
at least most of them did wait for the photo to finish, the one guy couldn't even put it down 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine playing against some fat guy, who starts to get tired after about 5 minutes. FINISH HIM!
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 20, '______________________________\n')
Are you playing on PC or console? I'm a console guy but loved playing the original Doom on PC. I'm just wondering if it plays well on a console or if it feels like it was definitely made for PC guys in mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dpad. A, B, start, select. Thats all you needed man.

All this jibber jabber about 4k gaming... 480P all day!

Im fucking old! LOL


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm mainly a console guy and have all of them but I personally don't see any use in getting a Xbox One S if you have a PC already.

If you are gonna get an Xbox, definitely get Sunset Overdrive but as for the rest, I would probably stick to buying them on PC, you could get The Switch when it comes out or a PS4 as that will give you exclusives you can't play on the platforms you have already? 

Just a suggestion :) 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Lol maybe not that one then.  I was thinking EUIV (and maybe CK2, depending on his interests).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Get him a pc so he can play loads of games with good graphics and more strategy 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They don't?? That's actually really surprising and discriminatory too!! Wtf man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't know if you've done the game, but the reason he doesn't move is because time is stopped.

Should see the part when it unfreeze lol.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Toad can't say shit after the "princess in another castle" debacle he pulled. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think they had guys similar to this in revelations that were chopping down your ziplines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because he needs to include his maymay titles to get the updoots
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm glad they are thinking of releasing the game on the Linus platform too, he really needs all the support he can get.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wtf? Lol man. You don't need to see a screenshot to be excited for a game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's going on with his NES? It seems a bit off. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That is plausible, I'm just curious on what titles you guys are interested in seeing on the backwards compatible lineup.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Having fun playing SMRPG for the FIRST time and he's on the start menu, lol. So fun.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i like the smell of ham boogers tails is allergetct to smell of hamburgers so he died from smelling the boogers
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this 2D platform? Also, this guy is releasing it for linux?! Neat! :]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just build a pc and he has my old i5 with a 7970
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If he has a decent rig then I would go with a PS4, a lot of Xbox exclusives seem to be porting to PC as well.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was confused why he wanted a console update of the PlayStation 2
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Was he trying to build a fort out of old NES machines? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It would have to be his screenshot for him to be able to do that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Be great if they'd make a decent PC port, those graphics in 60FPS+

a man can dream.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A modern day Romeo and Juliet. She plays PS4, he plays Xbox. How will these star-crossed lovers ever be together?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
considering he was using vats to find mines, smells like cheating, dogmeat responded...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he means beyond the basics that we can see from a glance, things like hardware for better performance/etc.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He could have made friends that have PS4's after buying his Xbox, or his friends could have switched. Plus, just because your friends have a console, doesn't mean its the one for you.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Considering that he still calls it next-gen even though they've been out for years already. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, he's playing on an xbox, so we don't even know if he has a PC capable of running those VR sets.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's also on Xbox, he's most likely talking about the backwards compatibly for consoles.

I think he'd appreciate a PS4 more as he gets older, more game options. I'm not a fanboy either, I have Xbox one and PC. I just think he'll get more out of a PS4 than he will out of a Nintendo. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
battleblock theater is fun. can't really suggest anymore unless you tell us what platform you guys play on i am assuming pc. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For some reason I'm a xbox guy... now I know why
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know what you guys are using, but gifv links are no quicker for me and often just don't work with my mobile browsers. They're great on a PC.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Scorpio will play games in 4k, the Xbox One S, which is what this man confused the Scorpio for, only does 4k video
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man I want to do this... what do I need for it? Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox one?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure he's talking about the USB xbox controller adapter in the image, not the controller itself
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But his point was that you don't "port to HD", you port to PC or a console IN HD.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's moving pretty well considering he's using the controller one handed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think it was all that great compared to the updated version. But man, it really brings back memories.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm surprised he didn't unfriend him even after all that lol
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What is the fuss guys? Do like i did. Build a PC and still own a PS4. I can play exclusives and get sweet 1440p and 60fps with everything else. MS games coming to PC so i have everything
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No I'm playing it on my ps4 and he's playing it on his ps4 at the same time. He's not watching me play he's playing his own game while I'm playing mine at the same time.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You basically made it seem like only PC players had the feature. I was just saying PS4 could as well in case he isn't on PC.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I mean he could just highlight it, right click and search google for it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Man, I'm dumb.

I thought he was referring to the shitty resolution.

Image compression ≠ low-res graphics settings
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to know what bait he was using. :D
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I assume he means in the sense that if you liked gaming, PC would be much preferable. Not including friends on each platform etc..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
PC version sometime in 2020 or when Elon puts a man on Mars, whichever comes sooner
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Next-gen console already? We getting the PS5 soon then? Or maybe the Xbox2? Come on guys let's just call them what they are. Consoles. I don't think they're next-gen anymore if they are the current console no?
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 21, '______________________________\n')
I was really sad after his death... I did end up crying as well... (your second thing I am referencing)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In reference to that, he mentions that in his "Far Cry 2" video.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
yet you can see his souls from his last death.....
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
3 main theories are that he is god/devil/ or death
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or maybe he was just trying to kill himself because you know, this being Dark Souls and all...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is it just me or are you guys not seeing the links and details? 
Looks great by the way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy is making every other Dark Souls player look like pussies. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I linked before and I linked again, he's even more [oldschool]( than you realize.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The human kings of New Londo, who possess the shard that once belonged to the pygmy(who created humanity with Darkness from the Abyss and the small amount of Flame he received.)

Everything else is pretty much right except this part, the Four Kings have a piece of Gwyns soul and not the Dark Soul (the Pygmy's soul).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's essentially what they did for every one of the games Miazaki directed.  Dark Souls 2 was the only one of the five he did not direct and is the only game with large differences between NG and NG+ onwards.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't know whether to be disgusted or impressed.

Aaaand he's gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dark souls series has taught me to be a more patient and cautious man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you guys call it you bee soft or oo bee soft
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I prefer that Zelda guy, from The Legend of Zelda.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i love this, for those few seconds u feel like the most powerful man on earth
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kevin Smith's cautionary tale about his anal fissure is all the warning I need to get in and get out
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He can summon his dragon to consume me any day
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
and yet I've beaten him - on death march.

But yes, he is an annoying enemy indeed. Quen and Thunder is your friend - and time. Also Dark Souls rolling.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What, that little guy? I wouldn't worry about that little guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Link? You mean Zelda right? The guy with the sword and hat? That's Zelda right? As in legend of Zelda? I mean it's the name of the game /smh
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Most people don't get that though. Most people think that Tyler is a hero when he's really just a crazy person. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean "Zelda." That's the guy from the Zelda games. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe while they're taking a break Tachanka will finally have his godly powers unleashed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't think he likes The Legend of Zelda series... obviously.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The true hero of the series is the guy in the soul cairn who devoted his life to extincting those winged Devils 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That guy is the postman from Majora's Mask? He doesn't look that similar.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
as far as i know there will be coming a thing with etienne where he plays quake. if that is true i'm really looking foreward to that!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's like he was put on earth to torture r/gamingcirclejerk.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
TheMrPudding and MrPudding

MrPudding because I like pudding and I'm a guy

&amp; TheMrPudding because MrPudding was taken
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But think about the king, a feeble, senile old fart that somehow has a Valkyrie at his beck and call

I don't know know about you but that's what I call true power  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What's going on man, everything is 'to the death with you' 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm similarly fucked up in Crusader Kings 2. My Muslim ruler has fucked every one of his vassals' wives, his aunts, his sisters.... Yeah.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Marlon Webb is the original creator, he is a Vine "celebrity"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course, but the creator of the video seemed to think he was being sincere.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"There is only one God and his name is Death, and there's only one thing we say to Death: Not today"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That's an inspiring Kappa solidarity you guys are showing. Might as well call it [Kappa Pride](
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I became a PS guy because of the Final Fantasy series
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Ohh man, the feels of playing that series. Will always hold a special place in my heart.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah man, everything needs to be dark and gritty otherwise it's for KIDZ!!  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then get out and punch them to death like a man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love this! Crazy guy who wakes up Link reminds me of this guy.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Brings new meaning to the Saiyan Fusion... but is this his final form?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the heck, man. I'm seeing you all over the place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Magus = Piccolo + Vegeta. Of course he's the coolest.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"Devil, there's a fly in my soup"

The other guy is supposed to be the devil right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He goes through a lot more detail in his other video, Limetech unRaid can pretty much do everything for this.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
if you're talking about the dark souls video he's almost certainly talking about epicnamebro. watch his 'from the dark series'
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I like the fact that he's playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy gets it. Ia! Ia! The faithful shall be devoured first!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dark souls 2 isn't that bad man. Game gets way too much flack. 
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 22, '______________________________\n')
Imagined guy saying it like this: (the surprise part)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Kat was the worst, man. I felt so fucking bad for her.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why is he here? If you go to a shitty restaurant and it's shitty, you wouldn't come back, would you? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No he kisses her with the mouth inside that one.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think sometimes he just falls to his death.

I guess he got his wings clipped.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He passed those huge ears off to his son.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because he says something doesn't mean he can't change his mind, which he did.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not going I lie, I don't know why but Lamar really pisses me off whenever he opens his mouth 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
the guy's just absent mindedly doing this shit like "did I leave the stove on?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Absolutely. There's a guy who likes to eat the the leaves off of our bushes, but we like him because he tips.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's like Bender, except he needs weed instead of booze.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
As for Gordon Freeman making it out alive. The right man in the right place at the right time can make all the difference in the world. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he is "Bearsuit0" which means he is a bearsuit.

As the Krogan say "Don't piss in my ear and tell me it's raining!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, this game has more triggers to people playing the game than triggers in he game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What happens if you kill the only witness before he gets away?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
i like the part where that guy fell in the water
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"...he said, Dorito crumbs falling from his mouth and getting trapped in his neck folds."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even know that was Loki, I guessed as much after he did the whole "How many times are you going to fall for that" thing to Thor.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow cause watching some guy play it for an hour wasn't enough. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Uuhhhh, I really don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. It's a big game, I'm sure he had more than two things in mind for it. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He should've just taken the poor guy out of his misery
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And it pisses off the Mittani because he's desperately tried to rebrand away from fatbee for reasons of marketability. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not entirely since it didn't show the guy giving the finger in the simulation.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 i love how the game closes out as soon as he falls as if it's running away from getting in trouble
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wow, I feel so terrible for him.

Died before he could ever play the game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Then why can't I kill the guy that would push me into the water when I can't swim. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dem three guys in the middle with their mouths open tho
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even know about this, I always impulsively executed him while he's tied up
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I want to say this is some X-man game about Cable, but I am falling flat on that...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Neil deGrasse Tyson should shut up and shave that tash off. What's he got to hide under there so bad anyway?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No kill means he just constantly eats wildlife to regain stamina. Takes absolutely ages! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mine lectured me cause I put my finger in to feel the seashells. Felt right man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What he doesn't tell you is that he's thrown up 4 times already
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Imagine it being said by the guy who got blowed up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even in the water, Magikarp looks like he's suffocating to death.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He smoked at a baseball game but you imply he got in trouble for smoking at his own concert?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the video, he throws it inside to stimulate a grenade.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well he said Was so he Thar must have passed away. Poor Thar. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That poor guy has been lost since the last time you played it. :(


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how he tried dropshotting, as well, to avoid it. Made it all the more satisfying to watch. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
what he probably means is he watches Netflix...and also happens to have E:D open
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At least two of these guys have VERY poor situational awareness.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And in the close up of him after you can see his tooth in his nose.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why he wouldn't tag that from the git blows my fucking mind. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You can't keep him here forever, Owen. Most of his friends are gone.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he killed him we wouldn't have witnessed his misery
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's not a guy hiding behind the bushes it is a ped with poor clipping,
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You mean literally in his parents? Like inside one of them? Wth? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He'd rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in his ear.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he'd change his mind if the paycheck was good enough.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 23, '______________________________\n')
Now you see I was never a big rpg guy when I was growing up. It's only recently in my gaming life that I've hunkered down and picked up a few. So I never played Kotor or anything along those lines.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That... literally... has no significance. There's like, six cutscenes in the whole game. In between then, I play as me. 

That's like saying Gordon Freeman is a boring protagonist because he doesn't speak. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you the same guy who posted that skyrim stuff saying basically the same thing?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
That side-quest was not the best, story-wise. It makes such a drama out of death, but you had to kill 5 guys in cold blood to get that cutscene. Plus, witchers aren't supposed to have feelings, so the trick was not supposed to work, probably
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If I remember right, Orcs (including the name) are his original creation but based on other creatures from myths like the goblins and trolls who he kept true enough, Dwarves were same as pre-Tolkien, but his main change was making Elves humanoid whereas before they were more like the Rice Krispie elves, or a sort of garden faerie.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy needs more talk. His previous videos (like Her Story's) is completely mind blowing!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Isn't his cape supposed to be special or something though
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You certainly weren't a vault guy in Fallout 2. You were the Chosen One, a descendant of the vault dweller from the first Fallout game. In the original, cancelled Fallout 3 the player character was going to be a prisoner, not a vault guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Actually when he does it it always comes out perfect. When the PC does it it's terrible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't watch the rest of the video after he started by calling BioShock Infinite a bad game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
ENCLAVE
 
An old hack and slash kinda medieval style game where you can pick a character and unlock gear for them throughout the game. Good story, good graphics for its times, decent enough combat and...its made by Starbreeze Studios, as in the PayDay and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons guys
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He said it was an option, he didn't say a good option
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Which is why I have never felt even the tiniest bit guilty the 2-3 times I have done it. In fact, it makes me feel like the little guy got in a jab at the big bully for a change =)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's definitely a dissolving effect you can see, though why he had that perk on a no kill run, I'm not sure.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This Nomanssky game is great.  It's about a  Polish guy who travels around the universe doing mundane boring shit that no one cares about.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought infinite was the very last bioshock of the series. Maybe that's what he meant
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Nothing to be ashamed of. One in five guys have problems finishing. Personally, I think it's all in your head!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, but the whole point of DnD is the players make the story too. If the DM wants one story and they players want another, but the DM forces his own story, that's generally considered bad DMing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Fallout.  Fallout 4 was an FPS with the option to be a good guy or a sarcastic good guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I definitely do. I love fallout I have hundreds of hours on fallout 3 and new Vegas, the dialogue forces you down a linear path in 4 like the enjoyment of the previous games was that I could be an asshole and go against the grain in different ways. Where are my choices in 4? Even if I start a new role as a completely different character he has the same voice? Wtf
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Dogmeat is the best companion by far. He's loving and loyal, he never complains about your morality or judges your decisions, he doesn't repeat annoying voicelines constantly, he's short enough to stay out of your line of fire, and he can packmule while still letting you use the Lone Wanderer perk.

I'll agree with Kane. He's such a badass villain and he's always back for more.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, the way I play also involves running past the knight, so I'm in a bit of a hurry to get past these guys
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I preferred Pagan because he has a lot more connections to the main character
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also: not an rpg, Mostly linear gameplay(aside of borderlands esque exploration), wack story, uninspired locations, lack of locations, lack of quests(and original ones at that).


Fallout NV&gt;Fallout 3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fallout 4



I just absolutely hated the game man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think that's his point. I lot of veteran TES fans consider Skyrim a bastardization of the series just like Fo3 fans see Fo4 as a bastardization. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well mgsv has the best gameplay of the series but it really lacks the amazing story the other games had. I also found that ocelot (my favourite character) was not consistent with his character in other games (why does he sound like Sam Elliot? He's supposed to be Russian). However, I felt that the ending was amazing, but u have to be a very strong fan of the series in order to get the full effect.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yep, and in this one, it's pretty much only about the main quest line. That and building settlements. I can't lie, I fully enjoy the settlement building; it's a lot of fun seeing what I and many others can build with it, and mods have made it even better.

I also fully enjoy the combat system in this one. VATS is still fun to use, but not essential, as it was in 3 and NV, but the "crit" mechanic they did for this one, which is basically just a guaranteed hit, completely kills the only other RPG element the combat ever had.

Like others have said, it's fun in the moment, but it's got no heart.

The quests are just completely buggered.

I haven't even gotten past the Memory Den in the main quest (though pretty much the entire story has been spoiled for me thanks to my brother and his loudmouth friends), and though I wanted to finish this one first, I'm tempted to just uninstall it and go back to Skyrim, which I also never finished.

The difference being Skyrim's world is HUGE and there are literally dozens of immensely engaging, fun quests to do along the way.

Bioshock: The collection, if he likes FPS and RPG. That's if he hasn't played it. Bioshock 1 and 2 don't quite have zombies, but the environment is similar to a "zombie" game and splicers could do the job. But the main thing is that those games' story is absolutely wonderful and he'll probably love them. Plus, the collection has Bioshock 1, Bioshock 2 and a DLC, and Bioshock Infinite and the 3 DLCs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he didn't say it plays good. It truly does *look* good. Beautiful unique art.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All I wanted was a not boring buggy repetitive game, but indeed, to each his own.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Apples and oranges man. Both open world games but completely different.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Either he has a good sense of humor or an unfortunate name.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should not play a bioshock game for his gameplay but for its story, beautiful crafted levels and narrative. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;In Witcher it makes sense though because your playing as Geralt and witnessing his story while having some minor control on what happens but ultimately, not deviating from his prescribed personality.

Is this pretty much what Fallout 4 is? You're not playing as some you want to be you are playing someones husband/wife they have some pre-determined personalty and the game lets you pick what road you want them to down be it sarcastic good guy or good guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well plot wise at least he's the main Skylander voiced by Justin Long in the new Skylander series on Netflix. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because he cares about the environment. Just not his environment.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Technically, yeah. That's why the game isn't ruined by him. But he's still the main character. The one you control from the beginning, and the one on the cover. 

I'd get into other reasons why he doesn't count, but that would be massive game spoilers and there are people here who have not played it, who yet might. If CosmicHerbs decides to play the game, they'll find out why renaming him "Crybaby" was particularly cruel. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They don't even need to be particularly good orders. It just gets people more focused than trying to every man for themselves.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Some people just have a different sense of humor, man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the Witcher lore, he did take a shit ton of drugs and that's exactly why he talks that way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not really, he wasn't that far out in space, and he moved his crosshair a few times. Probably memorized where it is for the sake of the gif. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
From what I can tell:
Dutch in the middle (main character?)
John Marston to his left
Bill Williamson to his right
Possibly Javier Escuella as on of the 2 on the far right?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I played both, and they felt very much like one and the same to me. But that's just, like, my opinion, man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Haha, Zidane is one of my favs. I like his humor, or the humor in general in IX. Vaan goes down as the worst main character, followed by early game Tidus (he gets a bit better later in the game IMO).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well aside from the fact that we know he ends up in that world (meaning he is not from it) we know next to nothing about the character so maybe we will get more story on him.... Then again you are talking about a platinum action game. As long as it plays well and is fun and challenging, story is on the back burner and will probably make little sense like most platinum games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You'll see that with mods. I'm pretty much just waiting for mods anyway at this point, FO4's quests a very disappointing. That and I feel like they're forcing me to play the good guy, which I usually end up doing but I really enjoy the option of being a complete douchebag.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, you really missed out. The ending is incredibly emotional and the post-game is superb.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Too much quest in-game how can you guys do it :o
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he is just trying to antagonize you. Skyrim IS better than Witcher 3.
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 24, '______________________________\n')
Wait what? He's saying owning one isn't absurd. Look at the last two sentences again. Why would you assume that he doesn't think people can do what they want with their money?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Made so much money that he doesn't give a shit anymore. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm 99% sure he is not talking number one if he is talking a sale price of $92.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, your break even point is if the game makes as much money as 1/3 of what Psychonauts would have if each and every copy sold was at full price.  Psychonauts wasn't that big at first and most of the sales after that were at a huge discount.  I got mine for probably $2 from a Humble Bundle deal.

I had a business expert look into investing for me (I wanted to invest).  He called them Junk Stock.  And he didn't look into it as detailed as the video that keeps getting posted here.

The fine print I was referring to is the simple fact that the game could make millions of dollars and every investor could see $0 and have no legal recourse.  Assuming the company that you're actually investing in (not Double Fine) still exists in a year (and it probably won't), Double Fine has no legal or contractual requirement to pay that company.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If they can't afford a new copy of those games, they still have options. They can look for it used, they can trade other games, they can start delivering pizzas at night to make the extra $30 they would cost. It's not like he just zapped their pacemaker by taking their ability to buy a 3DS game at below-retail cost.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This is one of the things that i don't like about games going digital more and more.  They never go on sale (talking consoles here peeps) and when they do it's never as cheap as you could find a disc copy for.  The worst part is that I love he convenience of digital and I've paid higher prices for old games more times than I care to admit.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Best part is he paid to be an advertisement. It usually works the other way around
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
All coming from the guy who's company only paid $524 in permits to take 27 million gallons from San Bernardino in one year while we are in a drought. While California is literally running out of water for basic living needs, his company is taking it for fractions of a penny per gallon and selling it. He's full of shit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm not sure he is. A rushed game can now be patched after release, most are, it's pretty standard now. What's more, consumers lap it up since a great many of them foolishly pre-order games or pick them up day one, even when they've got burned before.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
One big reason for that push is that it cuts out middle men and means more profit. That is all. The rest is bonus and marketing material.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You guys bought the game, knowing very well it had none of these features. Complain all you want.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy I bought it from was not selling another at that time but I'm sure he would make more!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Neighbour of mine paid about $750 per month on his (at the time) brand new G37. Including insurance he paid around a grand a month 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Companies get to make more money by selling the sale items at full price, thats why some only discount when customers bring this up. And if the sales person is on commission he definitely won't bring up the sale price unless he feels you are going to walk
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't feel bad for the guy. He's literally sitting on a pile of money he got by delivering a broken and unfinished product. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's got spec scrips he writes in his free time when he isn't buying guitars.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And yet recently he received an award in Kojima's name. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he's talking about that you don't have to pay for a service that you already paid for (XB1/PS4)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, he's made so much money that he has to keep buying scratch tickets. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Um, what?  "He's talented but because he bought a ton of expensive equipment he shouldn't be charging for his builds"?  Did it ever cross your mind that he might want to pay off the investment on that thousand dollar welder?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, get a load of these guys paying for a product! They should expect everyone to just give you free shit when it cost a ton of money to make like you guys. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What are you talking about. The product he got was not the product advertised. And i've bought plenty of legit, cheap items off sites that look like that. What about that scam is obvious? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I don't preorder games and I haven't bought DLC since 2012; Skyrim's bullshit DLC finally broke me from ever buying DLC again. Totally in agreement with you man, day one DLC is bullshit!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well it's probably worth more than 2k, buy he'll buy it back from you for 2k and then turn around and sell it at a profit. Or take it from your corpse if you die, barring all the New-U stuff
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What thrift shops are you guys going to mine just has 600 copies of Harry Potter. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its not that much assuming he's asked for nothing else. If his parents planned further ahead they could have paid well below retail for some of those games as some are old.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's saying that even in a year and a half he would be happy to pay $20 for Doom. Sometimes, you know, it's ok to just purchase a game at a more expensive price point in order to support the developers...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you guys have an online store? Because as much as I'd love to do it, I work entirely too much for a pilgrimage.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
At this point wouldn't it not matter because he has already given them his money?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes! Completely agree! If you are going to pay full price for a game and think that it is worth that price, then wait until it comes out. No store is ever out of the games and you can order them online, or just digitally download them. I've never been to a store and they say, "no we are out of this game please come back later" unless it was a limited edition or collector's edition. The new "standard" for games is going to change as long as people will pay for it. I've seen tons of games come out and the first option they give you is an $80 option?! What kind of crap is that! I'm not going to pay $80 for a game that is new unless I am getting something that complete justifies that price. (Sorry for the rant here guys).

So he hacked your email as well?  We're talking about an email that sends you a code in order to access your account on a new PC.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Passwords are not very good way of securing a account anymore, my friend had 2 very long and complex passowords, one for his email and other on steam, both got hacked on the same day by one person, to get access to his steam account, use 2 step verification when ever possible.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Gaming journalism is what hyped the game. Devs want to sell their product.

Gaming journalism wants clicks so they will say anything to get you to click on shit, man.

Don't fall for it guys! Only indie games are worth buying because we're not in it for the money! Especially mine!

i dont know, you tell me guy who has a 300 dollar unpaid tab.

CDPR is the only game company I really want to keep supporting right now.

Used to include Overkill, but fuck those guys now.

Good luck man, If I were you I would try to partner up with someone developing a indie title and collab with them. There are plenty of indie developers on reddit, music can make a game . So I am sure most would be down to work with you!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just stop buying Ubisoft games in general how many does it take for you guys to learn?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Zoki64 might do something like that for you... if you have the cash to spare (and he's not overly expensive).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I can't describe how happy I was to see you guys get fully funded on kickstarter! Can't wait for this game!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I personally say "EZ MONEY". Yes I am that guy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm going to buy in when it goes full Sao level. So I agree with this guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but what really happened was he was trying to get a fair price for his games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;They just copy/pasted stuff

There we go. Always gotta be that one guy. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
People with lots of money and nothing to spend it on. I know a guy who casually drops large amount of money on skins.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty certain that they don't get much (if any) of the preorder money up front, they just get information on how many people have reserved a game.  Like, I doubt Gamestop is sending a check to Ubisoft saying "2000 people preordered the new Assassin's Creed today, here's your money!" because Gamestop doesn't have anything to show for that.  They're essentially a middle man with no product to move, and left holding the bill if those people then cancel their preorder, or Ubisoft cancels the game.  My understanding was that your money remains with the retailer until they've paid for the product/received it, at which point your transaction is finalized and everything goes through.  Basically - 

*  You give money to store

*  Store sets up your reservation

*  Store orders x number of games and pays for them en masse once they are able (potentially adjusted for preorder volume)

*  Publisher gets their money

*  You pick up game

As opposed to

*  You preorder game

*  Publisher gets all of their portion up front

*  Retailer sits on their ass and waits

For that matter it wouldn't make sense to do it any other way, as most retailers will allow you to preorder a game (at least at a brick and mortar) for substantially less than the cost of the game.  If everyone preordering a game only puts down $5, none of that is going to the publisher until the other portions of the transaction are put through.

You should watch his other videos.  It's almost like watching a psychopath play video games, it's actually pretty funny.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Does this guy have nice pecs? Because it kind of seems like it.

&gt; Ross of Game Grumps

 Has one channel with 27 videos, is that his main channel?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I played the 3rd and loved it, but Primal really makes me happy man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He uploads on his own channel. Mans1ay3r or something like that.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Angry Joe does entertaining pieces that he calls reviews. The dude spoils the shit out every games. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh that would be funny! especially if the guys over at /r/reallifedoodles doodle something over it
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey I didn't have anything to do with it man
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man, thanks for the memories! I loved that game!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you guys wanna go hang ten by the quad on our hoverboards?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I actually started in another players system he didn't upload anything but still kinda sucks not being the first
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yoooo if you guys play online add me and let's play 
I used to play it a lot cuz I played with my cousin. I find out more fun with friends 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hey man, another Call Center drone here. What kinda stuff you do? inbound or outbound?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What does he do? Like... Wouldn't you get tired of the game? Or at that point do you even know what to do out of the game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So that guy is a popular youtuber ? People actually watch that ?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Even on his birthday, he still only gets a cake 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Its not my birthday I'm just here to wish you  ~~guts~~ guys happy birthday
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 26, '______________________________\n')
It also change he's depending on who's the home team. It's been like that for a while. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was the entire point of the gif. Methinks he didn't watch the whole thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Talking bout Silva in his last fight too. Hopping up on the wall as if the fight was over, even his team was telling him to get down. Then he ends up losing by points. Talk about embarrassing. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Change to the losing team to even out the balance? You're a better man than I.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
When all he can pick out are little things like with arkham asylum you know it's a good game.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They must have really eaten shit when he won all their rocket competitions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Maybe I'm not seeing it right, but that just looks like random jostling unrelated to what's happening on the screens/with his inputs. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he wasn't Batman and didn't do it to tons of people since then. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
but we just watched a guy lose the entire right side of his torso.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A private group of guys is actually working on it. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was a crazy game. My team's junkrat got a 4 man ult to get POTG. And our team lost in the end! 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
wins one after losing streak, now he is looking for revenge.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is the newsworthy bit here that a man in a Warhammer tournament is married?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He needs his anal glands expressed. 7 o clock and 5 o clock, give me a pinch
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And Pharah and McCree. The rest is good at flanking like he said, Junkrat is neither.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He said that he wants to stop server hopping as well. Unfortunately, I don't play on the
USA v2016 server.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But he literally did this in an episode of friends
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Both what happened in the gif, and what you said happened to my friend when he played it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well well well. You succinctly countered his horseshit. Fair play!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I guarantee this would have happened if he'd made it to 58.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm pretty sure this guy is matched up with me every time I play ranked (unranked).
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or his friend is on the other team and he wants to switch so they can play together.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Like the other guy said, Rocket League. Also Peggle and Monopoly Plus
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's probably just his IT guy hiding in the server closet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not that it's really important but he has like 5 times as many ranked games as I do. I mostly play hoops and rocket labs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Did he win? Did he lose? His wife, did she do some win win? His wife lost?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Glad it's not his.  Otherwise I'd feel bad about criticising his Blanka!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Of course ! Just don't come by whining about season pass and paying DLCs man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You played a 6 man Csgo match?

That must've been quite the accomplishment. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Do you do thumb gymnastics? Bendy thumb man. You should be a contortionist with thumbs like that 👍
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
cept in this gif, his team is about to lose by 1800 points.. soo..
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Says he who always loses. It is empowering to those of us who consistently win.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm amazed by all these kills at the start of the match.  I'm the guy on the receiving end of those kills.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Cyanide losing his shit every time womble ranks up is the best. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It is not a crit unless he was rocket jumping!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is he wall hacking or is that a new CS feature?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Amen, I can lose in csgo 5 times in a row and be calm as a whistle, but this game man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In single player sure, but competitive there's no way in he'll you're winning worlds without the best Ean available 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I suck with everyone on Overwatch except for Reinhardt, Junkrat, and Mercy. If all 3 are picked before I can get a pick in, GLHF, team, because you may as well be a man down.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'll believe it if he can win a Bo5 in BW.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The person that can count how many times he says " fuck" wins the fucking game. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Is this hacking or just CS:GO being shit? Look at the first two guys he shoots, the crosshair never is actually on them. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
For seeing how bad you are and to show you the top frag on the other team actually wasn't hacking, he's just better.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Meanwhile you can watch as his team loses every base
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
omfg all you guys do is whine. You even whine about whining.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought he was giving her a thumbs up for a second.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
What the hell is going on with his floppy thumb?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Awh :((( maybe some old rare guys will join if they start a spiritual successor !
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Or do they? Wernher von Braun has another trick up his sleves.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He must be allergic or something because he was running like a bat out of hell. 
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 27, '______________________________\n')
&gt;People down voting are stupid. He 100% belongs on any top5 if not contender for GOAT.

You literally called people stupid for not having your opinion, then said that he *has* to be someones top 5 favorite rapper.

tf are you on?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the most candid way one can ask a question on Reddit, how did he troll?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I hate having to come in and correct you, but attitude is also an aerospace term so he is correct
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
We voted "Refund of the year" award at the sub man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
How dare someone say badwords about PCMR.

The dude just said it was removed from the sub, no need to be an asshole calling his post low effort.

You can see the specs by actually looking at the picture.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Only has 47 hatchets in his hatchet account. And only 47 MLG quickscopes in his MLG quickscopes account. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There's a surprising amount of controversy about this comment... Are the angry misguided FFXIII fanboys doing this? Don't you guys have other shitty games to play?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
In the Tmartin case, being the owner of the site is easily enough reason to lie.

Lying about owning the site is not proof that he's *also* using it to cheat. (however likely we all think it is that he would)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It adds absolutely nothing to the conversation, it's like saying "LOL" in response to a text, how the fuck do you reply to that? It's just low effort and take up space that could be used for an actual conversation.

Edit: God damn you guys are quick to the punch.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;I never work out anymore

Well, based on the other comments, that's it man.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So basically slandering this guy's game now? The internet is a terrible place.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's allowed to state his opinion here as much as you don't like it. You seem to be defensive for no apparent reason
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sent him the sub so he can view information on the game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Source of what? Look at his twitter. Look at his history.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he's referring to how it's the original one that everyone on the internet knows about despite not knowing what a Trackmania is.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look man, we don't want to question this logic too much... 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't have seen it if he posted it to whatever other sub it is.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
OP already said why he wasn't getting that in the post.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I did say what I wanted, and you guys can't accept it. You keep telling me i'm wrong and redefining words here, there's nothing to discuss. Good news for you is that my opinion is in the minority. Rest assured. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
are you feeling threatened, or intimidated? says more about the person than the trolls. since this is the internet afterall. if OP was a man would you have sympathy? probably not
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Congrats you are the first person I have ever seen on reddit who is 100% wrong and proven so but you did not delete your comments. Good man stick to your mistake own your lack of understanding. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No but he's one of those guys who are so uptight, wanting everyone saying the title of the game in full of every submission on this sub, even though it doesn't matter all that much. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Mentally Unstable Maxwell would be more accurate as the "Mad" is more referring to his mental state than his emotional well being. 
[smokes pipe thoughtfully] 
However he is also quite angry as well...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But that is what I was talking about... so you decided to correct me based on some random thing you are talking about and then when I show you what I'm talking about you just say I'm wrong?

Don't correct me if you aren't talking about the same thing.

Have a good day man. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
just fyi it was a man that bitched there was another thread on that particular forum of a mother calling said change bullshit
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
You should probably report that person to the mods, man.. Just because you were misinformed doesn't mean that it's okay for people to harass you via PM.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah, it's not there because he deleted it... Internet archives don't lie. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Pretty sure he's talking to this exact post that we are commenting on. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I was wondering what he was asking. I elaborated on my comment. If you don't agree with my comment, then don't reply
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel like you did nothing but prove what he's saying. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wasn't becouse ss is diffrent? So? He saw ss entered application and made his own ss to make post from popular comment. Obviously it might be true that he didn't know but still doest this post which is comment from post few hours earlier should be top post?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I understand your frustration, but really, who gives a fuck? I don't actually care about fake points, I was merely poking fun at the fact that more people noticed one single (stupid) post of mine than every other one ever put together. It doesn't even matter to me, you guys are more care about me commenting on it than I care about my post's points.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hehe don't even know what the up vote and down vote really means for my reddit account but he I'm just here sharing my thoughts. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love how the fatties are downvoting you. I bet most of reddit sees some of themselves in this guy-- maybe not as extreme, but definitely overweight or neckbeardy
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After reading his comments i assume op is trolling. His history is nothing but cursing at people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Look, if he were dying he wouldn't have bothered to type "Aaargh"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet he got downvoted and you got upvoted. 

I think the sub in general might disagree. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah I love watching his content but I agree completely 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because it's his $ and he can whatever he wants with it is my best guess.  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I just mean that there was no reason to reply to his comment that way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;the actor who played him on screen has said that there is something to the theories.

The guy was playing a racist caricature of himself, of course he's going to latch on to whatever bullshit excuses or redeems that.

You are just giving Lucas far too much credit. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I thought it was him trying to correct the guy above him. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He has the gayest comments following it up too "lol my first time I can't believe it man xDDDfdd what's with this game lollol " 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because op didn't know ether, he reposted this with the exact same title as the last time this was posted.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt;It''s obvious you don't play this game.

&gt;since I don't play the game.

Well, yeah since he stated so.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Hahaha, it wasn't even something nitpicky, he simply said something like "none" meaning he didn't believe there was a single outstanding game this year. The kicker is that his name was something along the lines of Vault_Tec.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy gets it! See 7 facts about today's journalism, you won't believe #5. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
People are downvoting for him stating his opinion. So theyre personal downvotes then

How bigoted
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
See, he didn't ask for your opinion, what he really wanted was confirmation for his own already established opinion. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I wouldn't say that. Why do you argue that he's handicapped? If anything your first comment suggests that you feel as if he is overpowered? 
('\n____________________ TOPIC', 28, '______________________________\n')
So he basically changed the route settings on the GPS to "Just Cause"?

I think he means when they're sealed at the factory. They get shaken around a lot during shipping, which would cause them to settle toward the bottom. 90% is a bit high but before they're shipped, they probably are a lot more "full".
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This guy definitely needs to be featured in the next game
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Game are much smaller scale back then. One guy could be responsible for a lot of stuff.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Definitely. But I think finding a good solution to the radiation problems is paramount. I'm not the most knowledgable in this area, but I believe that no one has a genuinely good solution yet to radiation exposure in-transit since even in orbit we rely on Earth's magnetosphere to cover the gaps in what radiation protection we've developed so far.

It's not a bad thing that he's working on this--the problems need to be solved somehow--but yes, definitely a lot to do. Solving the issue of transit is just a part of the problem, though admittedly a big part.

Marcus Ingvarsson. We have a course called "Theme park" where we create games using a more unique input. Before the course he talked about several different examples of games with unique inputs and yours was one of them. =)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah man. I'm hoping they'll add them in a future update.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So 4 hours before the event they cancel?

Ya'll don't think it's more like "something else happened we can't do this, say something that sounds reasonable."

Additionally, the information in the article is limited, mentions no protests or anything. So it leads us to believe that the decision was made by the event organizers and not outside influence.

With a list of speakers that big, you'd think they'd also contact them long before canceling, let alone 4 hours before canceling. For all we know, any of these guys may have said "this is an all male panel, you should diversify, I don't want to get flack for doing this."

All we know is the USC said it's canceled, but with no direction as to the catalyst for it being canceled.

He said don't expect it because it's unlikely to occur not because it's impossible.  And he says it's possible.

You have to pull some mental gymnastics to make that the consumers fault for believing and expecting multiplayer.

Hence why I said general aviation. I'm sure the ATPL guys have significantly higher training requirements. I can't speak for them

You're taking that quote way out of context. He was talking about games being bigger than ever before but still failing at providing what he considers a meaningful experience. It had nothing to do with the monetary value of games.

As cool and impressive as this is, wouldn't it make more sense to just make the jump CGI? I mean, they are going to add in the buildings and stuff to the background, so the only thing that would be real is the guy himself, but this all feels slightly pointless?

I've got your point, but he promised a complete game until december 2014.  
I am a developer myself and i do know how that happens. You do something, you reach some basic goals, then you find some flaws in your core design, some things that you didn't know of. Or maybe you just underestimated your abilities. Or project complexity. Either way, you stuck.

And if you're a good guy, the promises you made really feel like a huge burden, they drop your productivity even lower.
Many of his updates are showing this in details.

That's why i don't believe in good ending for SCALE. But still, it is a very good idea. I hope someone will be able to do it properly.

Same result if he had handed him a fully charged galaxy note 7. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not entirely sure the game you guys are talking about but from what I gathered shootmania (if it's still around not sure) might be a good substitute

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
that's not what he said though, he said it'll be regenerated. as in, when you're not near the planet, it's not there to eat up memory, but when you revisit it, it all gets regenerated as it were when you were there.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It was around then, so things could have definitely changed for the better or worse. I've never gone back to them since then.
My s/o is an IT guy, so we just build our own computers now.

Everything he said is common knowledge for anybody who has used a ENB or Reshade.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah but if it was a rule then we just point to the rule and say "guys like this are why we have rule X" and shit would be chill. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If anything he's pretty fucking unlucky since I doubt he'd be able to play it for quite a while.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Why not just post the picture and say "*Someone* made a little place for the man that runs *their* computer to relax."?

I will never understand what goes through the mind of someone who can so easily lie for the attention of it. What a fucking creepy weirdo you must be.

I feel like Todd Howard is slowly becoming the next Peter Molyneux, except without the humility to admit that he's a lying fuck who gets too excited about what he makes.

That guy waffles on like some kind of ADHD suffering tool.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
His ideas are just ahead of their time.  Most of the things he talks about when announcing a game in development are features that would actually be awesome if our consoles and PCs had the power and input options to allow them, or in some cases if there were programmers that had any idea how to approach developing some of them.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Battlefield 1 is a WW1 game 2/5 of the stuff he listed didn't even exist.

If you're really motivated to change then good on you man! Don't give up! It's going to be a difficult process, but if you're truly determined, you WILL see the changes.

Best of luck! I hope to see before and after pics one day on here that shows how awesome you've become!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh, this again.

It is still showing a normal Windows update to the already installed Windows 10, probably set to fire at certain time... that he forgot about. 


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes it's been handled badly, but at the end of the day he was upfront and said "this feature will not be in the game" yeah it's disappointing, but people are acting like the lack of multiplayer is a surprise when he was upfront about it not being included at the end. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I met a potential distant relative the same way. We both share a last name that isn't too common and I have family in his area.

&gt;Vivec put on his armor and stepped into a non-spatial space filling to capacity with mortal interaction and information, a canvas-less cartography of every single mind it has ever known, an event that had developed some semblance of a divine spark.

As if that's not him playing around in the Construction Kit...
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
he still lied about what functionality the game has. this might not be a selling point for *you*, but it could be an important feature for others. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
people who aren't technically inclined have this idea that they have to know how to do extremely complicated things to install an OS. My best friend is outdoorsy and not a gadget guy. He couldn't do it without a lot of help. I'm not saying its impossible, just its not something a vast majority of people are going to want to do.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The guy gave one specific example. And that one specific example could have led hundreds to thousands of other people to just decide they hate a game simply because someone else said it sucked. That's the problem. /r/gaming is pretty bad when it comes to bandwagons 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
being a developer does not mean he knows every single word in the universe
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
It's almost like he explicitly addressed that in his post.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
To be fair, Iwata was the head programmer. Maybe he just assumed nobody could possibly be that big of a fuck up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
you're going to have a lot of eggs because his pullout game is terrible
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
or OS, if he's running windows. it's been known to be finnicky. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I think he uses this as an example because the key to this game is scavenging for anything and everything and being conservative with your ammo.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I feel really bad for this guy.  My situation wasn't nearly *that* bad, but I've sort of been there myself.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well now we got ssd's and higher amounts of ram and it's still comparable to older computers with less is what he means
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
no, he thinks it's the future.  

he knows it's the future.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Rare is not the same as "impossible due to us not adding it". If something is 100% impossible, you should not call it "rare".

If he could clear this up fully sooner rather then later, I wouldn't find it a big issue. The issue is with continued vagueness. He knows what people are asking - it's really not difficult to say "yes" or "no", so that people can make their own decision as to if it's a key feature to them or not.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So in that sense, he's the Louis Pasteur of game developers.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sometimes you feel like you have to protect the general public from an avoidable bad experience because you're a nice guy, and try to give it as much exposure as possible. Karma means nothing either, literally nothing
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well that would mean he's simultaneously existing as both his present and future self, what the fuck is he found on the internet!?  
  
When /u/slyburger13 from the present sees this, the universe will rip in two!

Do you really think the "SJW"s who fight against this sort of thing believe in anti-sexuality? 

It is about and has always been about not making women default to sex objects in unrelated media, a feminist notion to change females from being portrayed as male backdrops to having an independent role in some shape or form.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Whatever makes you feel better, man. I never said it doesn't affect your behavior, I said that it doesn't affect video gaming behavior. But if you want to live this edgy pseudo intellectual delusion, go ahead.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; Unless I'm also getting some sexy male cheesecake presentation. Then, rock on.

I think this is one of the roots of the issue- men seldom (never?) complain when men are sexualized, at least not that I've ever heard, but women seem apt to voice their grievances about female objectification. 

You are totally fine with male sexual objectification- but would you be ok with a game that has sexual objectification of both sexes in proportion to their predicted demographic skew?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I didn't even talk about his political ideology, yet the downvotes. But, as long as we're on the topic. Not allowing immigration of a particular type of people is against the principles of the first amendment, that's not really arguable. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He is just ... showing off he's a gamer, I guess . 

"Look at me I play games. Look at me gaming ."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The Spider woman pose is a classic Spider man pose, equally impossible for male skeletons.

Aside from Psylocke I think they all got reasonably close.

I met one of the guys that does their social media stuff.  He didn't look like he ever played videos games.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
But they are still just male and female and now they have to become gender fluid or all the gender studies and social justice majors will still be upset.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Just because they're his life decisions doesn't mean it's not bad for the majority of gamers.

Maybe you would've picked up on that if you weren't blind.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love it when people don't feel like real men unless certain circumstances are met!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Well, I'm sure it's all okay when a female artist does his yaoi fanart. 
It's just us guys being all rotten, with malicious intent to our art.

But you sure don't see guys complaining about it.

&gt;true feminism is about equality

there is a reason why every dictionary defines feminism as being pro-women either exclusively or at least as primary meaning.

Historically since birth of the movement it has **never** been about equality for all genders. Even in speeches mentioning equality it was always in context of making sure women were treated no less than men, but never the other way around.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
&gt; There should be sexually charged men and women in media because that is representative of real life. 


Try every action movie ever and the vast majority of leading men and even supporting men. They might not always be shirtless all day long but I'm not sure women sexualize men in the same way men do women anyway. I do see your point though, but the article is written like this is a first. I would say it is a little over represented but it isn't some massive "issue". Just my opinion.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
He's trying to right a wrongdoing involving a woman he loved. Don't think it'd be appropriate 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Are you saying women arnt allowed to like male characters? Or female characters for that matter.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
MRA's could get so much more done in this world if they could just talk about the issues they're talking about and resist the urge to make everything a "gotcha" about feminism.

Maybe the death of men-as-nurturers in the public consciousness is a problem *and* oversexualized representations of women in media are a problem. Maybe gender roles kinda fuck *everyone* up.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Zero excuse, yes. But I believe he was tough on his students for a reason. 

My personal view of the movie is that the main character would have *never* become the musician he ended up being without being treated that way. It was tough love, but definitely pushing the more extreme end of the spectrum.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No.. No it isnt. 

Is it an opinion that gay marriage has no affect on anyone but the people involved? Do gay people getting married affect others?

This is someone doing cosplay in a way that someone is being uptight about. It does not affect him. It does not change the character. It does not change how that person should think about the character. He can avoid it if he wishes. It is the same thing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Sure, in your case it didn't make a difference. But for someone else, having a role model in fields that are typically, say, disproportionately male, can help to push females toward those fields, even if only to determine if it's something they might enjoy.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh, those disgusting model posing applications! But there's so many of them.  Which one was he using?! Which one?!?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
No, he's not.

"Gay" means that you're attracted to members of the same sex/gender as yourself.

Clothing choices have nothing to do with sexual preferences. There are plenty of straight dudes who dress up in women's clothing.

But you don't get to be gay unless you experience same-sex attraction.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yeah! He's being sexist by not being sexually attracted to men, too!  
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
"can change how these men view women." because our minds are made of mush and can be molded by simply seeing a character in a video game. Oh wait, it's the opposite of that and most people can discern fantasy vs reality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I had male and female toons. The first one I ever got to 60 was a female NE. The first one I ever got to 80 was a Male Tauren.

It was all about creating a character, not declaring my gender or sexuality.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I love gotenks but that might be because I like all fusions, except kibito kai, especially the ridiculous names of his moves and the moves themselves.

Q for queer makes sense and is useful because it is inclusive without being specific.  LGBT doesn't include asexuals or without gender identity.  LGBT is lesbians gays bisexuals and trans people. 

Where does someone with Klienfelters with natural breasts and a penis, two x chromosomes and a y, without interest in either sex fit in?  

If they decide to dress with female cloths they aren't really trans because they have breasts and two x chromosomes.  Neither are they Lgb but they certainly don't fit comfortably into the 'norm' of straight male/female.

The benefit of Q is that you can end at Q.  Q as queer is something outside the 'norm'.  The initialism could just be Q and be 100% correct, just less specific.

LGBT misses the point, which is no exclusion based on how you are.  Lgbtjzhuwgvfkiwhuw (may or may not be correct initialism) misses the point because a list of acceptable gender roles and sexualities isn't what the movement is looking for.

LGBTQ is for acceptance in professional and personal life without gender or sexuality being considered.

Tl;dr Q is an important and necessary addition which supercedes the need for new additions.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Oh man how dare they want to be treated equally.

&gt; It's like you can't even have female characters with even an ounce of character, because it's seen as a flaw and mean.

Smurfette principle causes the Galbrush problem; when you have one woman in your game/film, all of her traits are implicitly representative of all women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The crux of his argument was that it didn't  fit the character. Stop bullshitting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Wait, what about the men in the game? I feel they are not a good role model because not everyone can have big muscles or become an ape, seriously? How can people expect to have someone like those as good role models?!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
If it were a joke it would be funny.  This is just an example of people looking for ways to feel like victims.  "Oh noes, fantasy role-play doesn't live up to my personal standards of gender equality - even though female characters are not gimped in any way and are equally and unrealistically just as strong as men in every game."
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
And then fled Hyrule because he was engaged to so many women.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
So why aren't more women directors, producers, even screenwriters then?

Is it always men's fault that women can't do things?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
why is it sad to prefer being alone? You can't fit ur ideals into someone else. If he has a preference for alone time over socializing you have no right to judge.

This is coming from someone who exclusively plays video games with friends fyi.

Only if you delude yourself into thinking there is something wrong with being shallow. Shallow behavior is completely normal for both men and women when it comes to finding other people attractive.

Gamers are generally awful, some of you guys need some self awareness.

Kratos creating unrealistic male body standards and needs to be changed /s

&gt;lol cus all women want a male power fantasy with bulging muscles who treats them like objects obviously 
 
lol cus all men want a female power fantasy with bulging boobs and ass obviously.  

&gt;Countless female characters that are sold by their ass, breasts, etc.   

But when he provides u with valid argument, u instantly deny it.
Such onesided story blind to all arguments.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Because Link is male and there is no reason to change it. If you really need to see a woman protagonist, play another game or make your own where you can decide that the protagonist is a gender free refrigerator.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Not bad for a supposed species that isn't male or female that's very clearly female. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
This post seems like a ploy to me. This is probably going to be used as an example of how video games are only focused on women's assets, and how the mind of men (target demographic) reacts to even video game version of a female body.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Don't quote me on this because I'm not sure. But I think men have better spatial awareness because they are men. Just as we are generally stronger and most physical sports separate the men from the woman. We have better spatial awareness so we separate men from woman. Also men are better at tracking things that move and woman better at tracking stationary things. Which could explain your question a little bit.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yes, but women should also be allowed to wear whatever they want and never be the *victim* of the *harassment* that the male objectifying gaze represents.  So yes, kill all men is the only answer.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Also, when the gaming first became a thing in the 1980s, women were just as involved as men were. Women play just as many games as men do ( 
It's only because of specific gender marketing that video games became for boys only. There is no excuse for the misogyny and sexualized harassment women face. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm a guy, and objectification doesn't particularly bother me one way or the other, but I'm going to play devil's advocate because I think comparing male and female objectification is a false equivalency.

I am assuming you are a man. How often in your life have you had unwelcome and lewd sexual remarks made at you by women. When in your life have you been seriously worried about being the victim of sexual violence perpetrated against you by a woman? I could go on, but the point is that sexual objectification has a different social context for men and women and to pretend otherwise is to be willfully ignorant.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
They aren't meant to look sexy but are still over sexualized. The point is they are overly masculine and also overly sexualized unintentionally. I could care less I have no problems with either men or women being over sexualized, but I don't think only women are that's for sure. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Love it especially considering how much Geralt has to deal with powerful women in his day to day life.

I feel like this would be at home on /r/cringeanarchy

Most male protagonists fit a certain mold too. Nobody wants to see a fat Nathan Drake.

If that's a guy I'm gay.   And I don't care.

&gt; It's not meaningless. It contributes to how people view you as a person.

      "My most important Pokemon Memory is pretty recent and rather sad. As a kid I always played Pokemon together with my mom. We would always by both games and each of us played one. 6 years ago I moved out and 600km north so my mom and I didnt see each other very often. Mom had stopped playing pokemon by then. I think the last game she played was Heartgold. Then my mother got diagnosed with cancer. She had therapy and everything and it was said that she has many years to live. Sometime in this period she tells me she bought a 3ds and Pokemon X after I told her how much I loved Pokemon Y. My mom sadly died to cancer November of last year after fighting it for like 5 years. As I last seen her she told me that if she dies, she wants my fiance to have her 3ds. So I opened her 3ds because I wanted to look at her Pokemon, how far she has gotten etc. Turns out she had only 2 badges which made me sad, the game gets better after the first 2 badges. Then, when I looked at her team, I saw she picked charmander as her Kanto starter (propably because it was my favorite, she loved squirtle) and then i saw her Kalos starter. She picked froakie (the same starter I picked this time) and the nickname of her froakie was my name. I immediately had to cry and transfered her team over to my copy and keep with me as a memory of playing with my mom when i was younger. Her froakie has a special place on my game and I will forever keep him.\n",
